76561198801166723,597970,False,2,0,0.496908009052276611,78,78,10,1,"I'm approaching this from the perspective of someone who generally only plays board games, and basically am looking for what could essentially be a board game but with an AI. I have only played this game about 5 times not counting the tutorials, but here are more impressions so far:

-The board game this is closest to is 7 Wonders or 7 Wonders Duel. It has the card drafting style of 7 Wonders, but the discounts and taxes of Duel, and of course it has a similar theme as both.
-However, this game would be pretty fiddly if it was ported directly to a board game. There are a lot of lingering alterations to cards from round to round. You could probably use Mystic Vale's card crafting system to implement it, but there would be a lot of sleeving/unsleeving modifiers. Moreover, you get quite a few discount icons in the game, so it would take a few seconds to figure out exactly how much you pay for anything.
-The combat is a lot less abstract than 7 Wonders and 7 Wonders Duel, which I like. Besides kind of a bidding for points like 7 Wonders (but more nuanced) at the end of each round, attack actual destroys your opponent's cards.
-The tutorial is very much designed from a video gamer's perspective, in that it teaches you just enough that you have to learn the rest as you go, rather than having most of the rules taught up front, which I dislike but probably wouldn't bother most people. I also read the rule book, but it would leave a lot unclear and I would not know how to resolve some stuff if the game wasn't automating things for you.
-I really hate how the 4 cards you take with you from one round to the next is random. With some smart drafting you can mitigate against the luck of an imbalanced tableau somewhat, but if you get a ruined building tough luck.
-The difficulty spike from normal to hard is huge. Hard is probably the right level of difficulty, but ""normal"" is more like ""easy"". I am getting stomped by hard but even in my second game I got over twice the score of the normal mode. Really wish they had a difficulty level in between.
-Card effects I would say right now are on par with the level of interesting as 7 Wonders, although I don't find the cards in either to be particularly unique. However, since some of the cards are initially locked in Age of Rivals (which I don't mind, since it gradually teaches you the card pool), maybe they will get more interesting down the road?
-Overall, if this was a board game I wouldn't like it, although it is a fine but I wouldn't call great video game. It feels unfair with the random keeping of cards in your tableau between rounds, even if a better player/AI will overcome any unfairness more times than not. It has a lot of things that would be fiddly to keep track of in real life, and while the video game automates it for you what I like about board games and what I seek in my video games is complete transparency of the mechanisms. Those negatives aren't enough to make up for its improved combat system compared to 7 Wonders.",1608324955,1608324955

It has several victory option between economy, military, culture. Leaders do not give effects but guarntee 3 cards of different levels each. There's a campaign mode, but all the cards can be grinded with in-game coins. 
And all is all, there will come a point where you'll get all the cards and have nothing left to do.
Gameplay is fun, if not a bit complicated, and doesn't get slower than necessary. The artstyle is generic and has too many PoC to be comfortable. While the cards themselves describe different actions, every type is represented by the same picture. I.e.: War elephants and knights are both represented by the knight picture because they're cavalry. This is a low budget game, so it's understandable.

With the limited art and limited cards, at some point you run out of things to do, eventually there isn't much strategy involved, as the build you were successful with a month ago is still going to be meta a month from now.

The designer claims the AI doesn't cheat and I'll take his word about that. But in the campaigns the AI gets fantastic special cards and also seems to get draws that support these special cards. Even worse, it seems you have to beat each scenario (only 3 per campaign, 2 campaigns) at both difficulty levels, normal and hard, before moving to the next scenario - never encountered this before and it is a really poor idea because I can't progress past the first scenario.

You earn coins as you play and for doing quests, which let you buy packs of cards that randomly give you more cards that will show up as you play, or character cards that let you work towards unlocking 3 special slots for the various decks.

The special slots let you guarantee a card will appear in your game, and they're the only control you have over your deck. Unlocking them goes quite slowly though, in 3 hours I had only unlocked 1 slot for most deck options, and I hadn't unlocked the second slot for any. Basically you're presented with the knowledge that you could inject some strategy into your deck, but you won't be allowed to for many many hours.

Each turn each player is shown 4 different cards and buys 1, then the remaining 3 are passed to the other player. The first cards presented to each player every draw dramatically affect what you can do, especially if it's an instant knockout card. 

Then after every round you randomly keep 4 of the 8 cards you bought that round, which will carry over to the next round. The difference between the game picking 4 resource cards vs useful cards is massive.

This game left me feeling more frustrated than anything else. If you're looking for a strategic card game, I recommend you look elsewhere.",1536310092,1536310092

I like a challenge, but this is not challenging nor does it involve any strategy when a player has no chance of winning. Trying to get packs is very grindy as you get few gold (20 mostly - you pick a chest out of something like 30 chests with only a small few being 30, and one 50, with rest 20 - higher diffioculty only increases this marginally) for a card pack that cost 100 and only contains 3 cards. You get more if you win, but again the AI and constant losing. So expect a great amount of grinding. You get to choose portraits that have up to 3 pre-selected cards that have a chance to provide your choice of card as one of the cards you can buy with resources during the duel. However, this is also a grind as in order to unlock the 3 slots, you must aquire multiple portraits of the same one from card packs. It takes 3 or more to unlock so you continue to grind since each pack only gives you 3 cards. Even if the game only gives you cards you don't already have, its still a freaking grind. The portrait feature again doesn't seem useful as its only random if at all when it activates. The game has potential but could use better, more realistic AI and a better reward system for new players to get more card packs early (not asking for all cards here, just reduce the grind). The portrait system would be better if when it activated provided your card choice that didn't cost resources. However, the poor AI mechanic is what mostly ruined it for me.

So you need to adapt a strategy every round. Any resources you build become future discounts for you while they also become taxes against opponent, if they take a card aligned with those resources. 

Some cards combo specifically with the next card you buy, and your opponent will know and see it. Do you bluff the next buy? Do you instead choose the card you think your opponent will want, or do you choose the card that gives you an edge in combat? Maybe that victory point card is too good to pass up?

The difficulty in the game lies in keeping an overview of both your own and your enemies options, however, I wouldn't call it a mostly skill-based game, because the randomness of the choices you're offered for card selection play a big part in you gameplay. It's hard to have a gameplan beforehand, mostly it depends on your ability to adapt to what is offered to you.

Good:
+ Engaging gameplay
+ Nice combination of card game/city builder

Needs improvement:
- The UI is not great
- Deckbuilding
- The pack-opening is kind of irrelevant, card-collection kind of feels irrelevant, it makes you wonder why they don't immediately give all the cards.
- Card special abilities are not always worded clearly enough. I find myself often surprised to discover a card does something very different than what I imagened from reading the card text. In extention of this, it is not always clear in what order special abilities are performed.

Though I list a few serious items that could use improvement, I still recommend the game, because these items are not gamebreaking. For its price this game offers enough content and enjoyment, just don't expect the perfect game.",1500827802,1500827802

Behind that simplicity of gameplay is a cleverly designed, exquisitely well-balanced, damn fun little game. You can get the hand of it in 20 minutes, but appreciated the full interplay of the cards and game dynamics takes a bit longer. Still, after 10 hours I felt confident and was winning more than half my games against other players.

Part of the genius of the game is that, while you can guarantee you will draw up to 3 specific cards, in general each game will have very different start conditions and card draws. You can design a strategy around a particular horse cards, for instance (there's a nice little strategy around the Four Horsemen card that I enjoy), but if you don't luck out and pull horses in as a resource at some point, your strategy just won't work. Fortunately, that's not the end of it. If you are flexible and quick on your feet, you'll cobble together a new strategy on the fly, and can still pull out a win, even without a single horse.

The point is that you can plan a strategy, but often it goes out the window quickly and it can became a mad, seesaw contest that neither opponent is sure of until the very last card! Of course, routs are possible, but even as a intermediate player against seasoned opponents, games are often very interesting right through the last round. 

There's nothing quite as a satisfying as pulling off a victory in the last round, after trailing in the first three. It happens.

There are plenty of things the game needs to develop into. Alliances are rudimentary, there is no pre-game chat forum, and no in-game chat (aside from about 8 scripted one or two-word messages). There is no way to spend money you accumulate after you have all the cards (that's about 15 hours of game play). Graphics could be improved, there are only 6 campaign missions. But all that will come if the game is a modest commercial success, I'm sure. 

All in all, at $10 this is a total bargain. I'm getting far more enjoyment out of it than I did the $60 I paid for Civ VI, which I hardly played. Unlike Civ series, this game is laser-like in its design simplicity, has a well done AI opponent, is full of surprises and is just a delight to play.",1500809329,1500809329

There's a lot of interaction between the cards that makes it work on a vastly different level from other card games out there. 

Even Gwent with its 2-3 rounds per match and different rows doesn't reach Age of Rivals' complexity. However, the game remains extremely simple and intuitive despite it all. Card texts are crystal clear and after the first two rounds you'll already have the hang of the basic rules and design intentions, if not the finer strategical details. Go big on cash generation, excessive culture output or just keep the opponent down with devastating attacker cards? There are many ways to win and enough flexibility to adapt on the fly, due to it being a deck builder game. Synergies have to be planned for in advance to succeed in the later rounds, which is oddly satisfying to pull off.

Being able to exclude a certain fraction (like 1/3) of your cards for each cardtype would greatly improve this.

First of all, this is no CCG. The game is pretty much a virtual board game, with some unlocks to try to keep things simple at the beggining. No in-app purcheases means that everything is unlocked very quickly, since there's no incentive for the developers to make you grind.

The game is quick yet highly complex mechanically. Expect some moments where you're left wondering what happened after some interactions of cards. And there are some mechanics that you'll only find out about by reading the in-game rulebook (which is short, but very informative). I found no bugs so far, which is fairly impressive given the mechanical depth.

Luck seems really important at first, when you're still learning about the game. As your skill improves, it becomes clear that this game is first and foremost a skill game. The implementation of randomness makes every game feel unique.

7 Wonders plus Dominion plus Through the Ages. You take turns drafting cards to build an empire and then, when all 8 slots are filled for the turn, you squabble for neutral settlements, wage war on each other directly, and then score points based on the cultural value of what you've built. Since you can never know what cards are going to be available for you to draft, you have to carefully balance your economy, unit types, war capability, and cultural value. 

The end result is an engrossing card drafting duel game that has massive replayability and plenty of opportunities for inventive strategies. I highly recommend it. 

If you don't want to pay money for the game, try the free version hosted at Kongregate and see if you like it. The only difference between the web version and this paid version is that the web version has slower progression.

Pros:

- Really easy to unlock new cards
- Very good matchmaking
- Can play against hard AI to earn gold or actual players
- Will earn gold even if you lose (hard ai/player) if you do not concede. This is very nice feature because you do not feel like you have wasted time like with many other CCGs
- Has Booster packs but the game only gives you cards that you actually need (you might see the same rival card more than once but its actually unlocking new slots that you need!)
- I love that this game features 'simulatenous turns'. So both players play at the same time. Lot less downtime then competition!!
- Really deep strategy and it allows you to pick guaranteed cards (so you don't technically build a deck but you have some minor control over certain cards appearing and if you don't buy it the opponent can!! LOL Brilliant!)
- Has daily quests but they do not feel punishing in the least or tedious. You are never forced to play an awful quest from what I can tell

Cons (I really cant think of anything I dislike):

- Make more fancy audio/vfx (but it is still very, very good work here; just lacking intro animations)
- I have trouble connecting from work (need to contact the dev about this-- I really blame my company for this)
- There are some RNG effects

It feels a bit like a two player version of 7 Wonders but mechanically plays very differently. As in 7 Wonders you are drafting and passing cards to your opponent over the course of the game, building your deck for the final fourth round to try and construct an impressive set of eight cards out of everything you've drafted previously. Also as in 7 Wonder the cost of cards is a mix of gold and resources and owning those resources makes it easier for you to buy related cards and earns you taxes from your opponent if they have to buy those resources from you. And like 7 Wonders the cards you draft become more powerful and expensive as the game progresses and can synergize well with each other with good planning. 

That's basically where the similarities to 7 Wonders ends. Age of Rivals is a much more confrontational two player game. Military cards directly attack your opponent's cards with defeated cards earning no points at the end of that round and at least one defeated card each round being permanently ruined (ie turned into a useless waste card in the deck). This gives the game a much more aggressive feel as the opposing armies directly pound each other and capture neutral cities for bonus points. It also makes warfare much more interesting in that you have to decide battle to battle which cards will absorb incoming damage and which cards you are willing to potentially lose. 

The game has a large variety of cards and Rivals (aka your avatars each of which plays slightly differently). Multiplayer and challenges are included as well although personally I enjoy just playing against the computer for quick games. If you are a fan of 7 Wonders and are looking for a relatively reasonably priced computer game that might scratch that itch this is definitely worth a look.",1494084290,1494084290

There are always some decisions to make, although just like most drafting games, there aren't always multiple good options.

Being able to see your opponent's draft options [and occasionally being passed their leftovers] makes for some nice next-level metagaming, as well.

This here Age of Rivals is really really good. Especially if you already play Hearthstone, Magic the Gathering, or other CCG type games, you will fit right into this. (Especially Hearthstone--this game, like that one, has effects that couldn't really be carried out in a non-online game, like cards morphing into other cards etc. Also, heroes with special cards. And this one adds an aspect of cards being permanently altered even when returned to the deck.)

The game is intuitive, invites deep gameplay, makes thematic sense, offers multiple paths to victory. And it plays quick!

You have to pay close attention not only to your own plan, but also to the cards available and to what your opponent is doing. Even if you start a game with a certain strategy in mind, chances are you will have to adapt it as the match goes on. As a result, you are always engaged, trying to combo your cards and counter your opponent. I find it very fun, and recommend it for players who like complex, interacting mechanics and engine-building games.

I think i would like the game more if the elements of it that are down to sheer luck were a bit reduced, but that's is just my personal opinion. Sometimes it just seems like the computer always has first dibs on the resource you need, or always ruins your best card. Anyway, great game for players who like a mental challenge! =)

There is no play to win, in fact once you buy the game there isn't even an option to spend money on cards. You gain additional cards simply by playing the game. I love this feature, and wish more collective card games followed this structure.

So how is the gameplay? It's very easy to learn, the tutorial is very hand holdy but perfectly explains everything there is to do with the game. And I strongly advise you do the tutorial as you get enough in game gold to buy your first couple card packs.

That being said, this is a game that's deep as the Grand Canyon. There are several different ways to win a game. Decks can be influenced to be culture points oriented. Culture points are the easiest way to win, as you will get more of those by volume than anything else. You can be attack oriented, this works because you get points for the 'conquer' stage where attack matters. You also have a chance to knockout all your opponents cards before they have a chance to score. There are also so many support cards that add or subtract points, attack, defense, etc. Cards that influence your gold, cards that allow you to pick other like cards. Cards that synergize with each other to make greatest gains than they would alone. The strategy is seemingly endless.

This game has both normal and hard difficulties for Single Player play. The AI is smart, even on normal. There are also challanges that allow you to get rare cards. The AI in challanges are purporsely well above even the 'hard' AI and will punish every little mistake you make.

There is also muliplayer. You can play against a friend, or you can play a random person online. Playing online allows you to gain bonuses to your gold if you are in a faction. There is also a monthly leaderboard that rewards gold for people that dominate it.

I have 32 hours in the game as I'm writing this and I just now unlocked every card available. There is plenty of bang for the buck. This is a highly recommended game for me.",1490589873,1490589873

However, the game does have a few disadvantages. One thing I don't really like about this game is that much of your success is dependent upon the random cards you get during the first round. If you don't have strong cards, you do not have a chance at winning. Even with good strategy, you usually cannot find a chance to catch up and get on the winning end of things if your first two rounds are beaten.

Right now, I would recommend this game even though I rate this game as average currently. The game would be tremendously improved if there were lifelines such as wiping out all victory points gained by the rival for 1 round to increase chances of winning. There will be others who will disagree with my assessment, but for me, there are many opportunities to expand this game such as adding more different types of cards and more pathways to spend the gold coins you‚Äôve earned by winning.

What we have here is a really well-crafted card game, with a board game feel and some wonderful design work. Each game feels quite unique due to the cards that come into play making reappearances later on- I think it is fun to imagine a story to go along with each game and strategic play, as towers crumble to angry mobs, trade routes form and gain monopoly on desired resources, and empires resort to thieving and over-taxation out of desperation.

I did want to touch on something a lot of people have talked about, though. There are complaints out there that this game is ""too random"". In certain gaming circles, ""random"" is pretty much a dirty word- people want their games to be entirely deterministic, but I believe this should not always be the case. Chance is a big factor in many famous games, both videogames and otherwise, and there is nothing wrong with using randomness as an element of your game's design *if* it is balanced well. If it isn't, it's extremely frustrating and pointless, but when it is, it can be an integral and fun game mechanic *while still feeling fair*.

The game does utilize some randomness, especially in the drafting mechanic, but it uses that to it's advantage. Instead of being a card game where you have to painstakingly handcraft your deck and worry about being countered by someone else's and losing before you've even started playing, in this game you are building your deck as you play- building your deck *is the game*. The interesting twist on this title from other deckbuilders is that you have to work with what the game gives you. You'll end up playing quite interesting strategies sometimes due to the cards that come into play, and you also are given a lot of chances to try and counter the opponents deck as they are building it (though they might try to do the same to you!).  

There's also an element of risk-management in the element of chance in some card's effects, but you are meant to either use probability to your advantage (e.g. playing only one card of a type to guarantee it receives a certain buff), or take the chance of a negative outcome as the cost of playing a certain (usually more greedy) way- there has obviously been a lot of thought into the balance of when a little randomness could both help the card's balance and add some interesting strategic plays and moments to the game. I understand that gamers see all randomness as a horrible force of evil, but it can have some very interesting design implications, and if well tested and balanced the results can be a game that's even more balanced, replayable, and fun than a game that is entirely deterministic. 

This all comes down to personal taste, of course, but you can't deny that the devs have cared a lot about making each card feel fair to the game, and the synergies between them are where this game really shines.

The only complaint I have about this game is that each card lacks a bit of personality- this is because each card as the same type-based artwork which, while quite pretty and identifiable, doesn't help make the cards stand out from one another or feel unique. I also think it would be neat if the cards each had a little flavor text, or even a fact from history, to give them even more flair (and give you something to look at while you're opponents make their move. I have asked the devs about this, and they are on board with the idea of adding flavor text in the future, and haven't ruled at doing individual card art at a later date, so I don't think this should be a dealbreaker, especially given the continuous dedication to the game the devs have shown.

In conclusion, this game is absolutely worth a buy, especially if you enjoy deckbuilding games and want to try an interesting twist, or want to try a really well designed one out for your first foray into the genre :)",1490254586,1490299196
