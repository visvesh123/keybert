The combat is a little janky and takes getting used too and your depth perception is going to be wildly off, but once you get used to it, it is an enjoyable experience if not a brutal one. It's a rogue-lite game where the gimmick is every time you die you are thrown back to level 1 and you lose some money, levels and skill points. The only thing that stays are your items that you threw down the chute otherwise what you have on your person or equipped is lost. One of the best moments was reaching a mini boss of sorts on the first level that will teach you in a subtle way that you can knock enemies into spikes with your inventory bag to kill them instantly.

The scaling feels off somehow though and almost unfair. I have finally triumphantly defeated the spider boss and got my first purple gear which was awesome and weapons that hit harder than what I was using just to go to the next level and basically get one shot by a charging enemy and any enemies that I could fight took at least 10 hits from these brand new weapons that I just obtained and would hit me like a truck despite having 2 blue pieces I just bought prior to the spider boss and that purple armor from the spider boss.

PROS:

* This game really captures the best parts of a classic action RPG when it comes to loot.  I honestly have been bored by most newer RPG loot since Diablo II.  This takes me back to that feeling.  The gear you find matters A LOT, and it's not just a pure numbers game.

* The skill system is unique and interesting.  Gone are preset paths.  Instead you get points you can use to lock in skills items provide, or a random one you get every other level.  You can choose what to pick or buff, or sit on your points hoping for a game changing skill to appear on an item to invest in.

* Creativity is rewarded.  Sure you can slash your way through everything, it's in the title.  But you can knock enemies into spikes and pits to get insta kills, if you can manage it.  You can try to even build your character around it.

* Good sense of humor.  The game makes plenty of meta jokes, from referring to your inventory in serious lore parts.  To weird posters on the wall.

CONS:

* The game relies too much on just making enemies tankier and doing more damage, rather than introducing more enemy types.  To the point that your first run with every character will be a slog every floor.  Yeah, you can sit there and block (melee) attacks to grind through it with no damage, but it takes forever - sometimes spiking things isn't an option.

* READ THIS IF NOTHING ELSE!: The middle three floors of this map RUIN the game.  Suddenly the game is full of platforming challenges, which are often REQUIRED to proceed.  There are NO platforming challenges in the floors before or after these middle 3 levels.  And that wouldn't be all that bad if it weren't for the fact the platforming is VERY BAD. 20% of the time your jump inputs WILL BE EATEN and you WILL fall.  Many of these have spikes at the bottom which do a TON of damage.  And no, I""m not just bad, I've beaten many a troll platformer in my day.  It's just bad,  doesn't work, and stands out like a sore thumb from the rest of the gameplay. [Damian please get rid of these, this game is otherwise a 10/10]

* More middle floor issues: The middle floors also have 10 times as many traps as the floors both before and AFTER it.  Rolling hallways of spikes, swinging blade traps, rapid fire turrets.  Any of these on their own is not an issue, but often they will all be in the same place and make it impossible to not take damage.  Even worse, often their will be ranged enemies that also back away from you as you get close in the hallway, making it even harder.  This is ON TOP OF enemies being extremely tanky by these floors, making it even harder to take out the ranged unit

* Ranged enemies.  There's no way to block ranged shots except for a rare skill which I've only been able to lock in on one run.  One or two two is a nice challenge, but some rooms will have like 5 moths, which are the unit that backs away from you while firing.  They can back over pits where you can't melee them, or fly too high up to melee(I haven't seen this in a bit, it might be fixed).  You may say ""just shoot them"", except in this game you have very limited ammo.  Which might be better used for skulls, another flying unit that almost always floats out of melee range, with some variants that never charge at you.  I think the best fix for this would be to get rid of the ammo mechanic, I could live with it, even when they're in terrible death hallways.

* Bosses are too easy.  You'll see a lot of threads from new players that ""the first boss is too hard"".  As soon as you know it's gimmick though it's the easiest thing in the world to beat.  Drop a bomb on it's eggs when it lays them, and kite it onto the acid it leaves behind.  I'd fight this boss 1000 times before I'd face a single moth in a spike hallway.  However the final boss is also too easy.  Unlike the first, the main villain just yells over and over at you how to beat him for one.  And again like the first, once you know the gimmick it's easy to beat without taking any damage.  Floors are MUCH more dangerous than bosses.





TL:DR - You will have a lot of fun with this game for the first 3 floors and the 4th floor boss once you figure it out.  Floors 5-7 will ruin the game for you. 8-11 you will be pleasantly confused that the difficulty seems normal again.

Everything hits so hard, traps everywhere, loot wasn't much better.

The art style, the theme, the fragmented story you learn as you progress through the dungeon is all great, however the combat goes from okay to bland very fast and the difficulty ramps up fast. This isn't inherently bad, but it seems it's intentionally designed around preparing for your next run. This is obviously fine in roguelikes but again it becomes much more bland than roguelikes of a similar nature. You fall into a pattern of get good gear, dump good gear into chute for next run, die then try and find better gear than the gear you dumped the first time in order to dump that gear. It wears down on the player especially since most people will probably hit a wall around the first boss or the level after as, as i said, the difficulty becomes insanely hard, Enemies that look and act exactly the same then can one/two shot you. Obviously this is intentional and you're supposed to level up and get better in order to overcome the difficult levels, but without a skill tree, 3 very bland stat-booster skills, you're really reliant on gear. 

There are other annoyances such as the physics of boxes and barrels getting you stuck or wedged into hallways and flying enemies with no real way to attack aside from wasting time trying to get them to come to you or hoping you find a wand decent enough to kill them with the few charges it has. The game has these things called ""challenge rooms,"" that aren't any different then every other room and there's no real way to tell what rooms are challenge rooms. One of these rooms had an enemy glitch through the floor causing me to become stuck as there was no way to kill them and no way to leave the room. 

I enjoyed this game for the short time I played it, but I really can't recommend it for most people. I feel the average player will hit the same wall as most people do, then get bored and move on.",1615277580,1615277580

     For days and days he slept. And when he finally woke, he looked up and his gaze fell upon a figure in the mist. The figure extended his hand and when the man reached out his hand to grasp it he was struck down, and back to sleep he went for another day or five, I don’t know. And as he opened his eyes, he yet again saw the hand extended, and once more he reached out and was struck down. And on this went: sleep, wake up, get knocked down, for a thousand days, or years. But the man’s faith never wavered, he reached for the hand each and every time. 
    And his head grew sore from the beating, and he grew a great horn on his head from where he was struck. And after some time he awoke, and he reached out, and his torturer gripped his hand tightly, and he pulled the man to his feet. And still the man spoke no ill of him. And that’s not why, instead his horn was broken off and melted before his very eyes. And it was poured upon his skin until it engulfed him whole. And then that shell of his grew darker and green and then red then finally golden. Because, you see, the man was rewarded for his devotion! And now the two stood, one before the other, as equals! 
    They stood for a day or so, until the winter came, and the man who once stood his master now bowed before him, and then laid flat on the ground face down and fell asleep. And so did all the other people of the land, as far as the man could see. And in a day’s time or a week, one by one they would wake and the man wandered around striking them down as they tried to grab his hand. And the man did his duty as the seasons passed him by until he came upon another man in autumn, who did no sleep and did not lie. And he spoke unto the man. He said “be gone”, and the man went and gone he was. And when the weather turned and thunder tore open the sky, there came an ill wind and it shoved him over; to his knees he fell.

I expected to get my money's worth - which for me would have been maybe 20 or 30 hours.  

What I didn't expect was how well it lent itself to playing a second or third, or tenth time.  Kudos to the Developer - I think this was a hit.

Not that I didn't find some things annoying.   Getting slowed down or, caught up on small debris or on the edge of stairs introduces a level of ""tedious"" that wears like a blemish on an otherwise smooth experience.  I didn't hate the parkour portions, but less of that would probably be better (IMO).

There are games out there that are better, like Hades or Dead cells, but if you are tired of them - try Slashers keep, it's quite worth your time and money.

Good stuff:
+immersive 3D action battles with tactical parry system
+intresting ""comic'sy"" sprite graphic
+variety of perks
+ability to craft super strong but silly looking weapons
+fun factor due to a bit of sillyness here and there.
+you can smack moles with a loot sack!
+the game runs well and smooth, hasn't seen any bugs in 50h playtime.

Neutral stuff:
difficulty curve - during your first run you will feel weak, miserable and frustrated. But if you continue to play the same character and aquire enough perks - you will feel like an unstoppable god of war. Snowballing really gets out of hand later on.
[strike]anime was a mistake[/strike] Second biome was a mistake. Jumping puzzles waste a lot of time and the number of spiky and thorny things is really excessive to my taste.
Just 3 main weapon types - swords, axes and maces. And due to their sheer strength most people use only the later one.
Way too many repetetive monsters, and most of them persist through the all biomes. Not enough enemy variety.

Negative:
-with levels monsters only get bulkier and hit harder but that's it. no intresting modifiers/perks/conditions, just more hp.
-hot goblin girls posters are only in the first biome!!!
-just 3 biomes, not enough details on them either. the same walls all the time are kinda sad to see.
-literally just 2 bosses. spider and the last one. Totally not enough in my opinion. 
-lack of a truly unique weapons/equipment. Like literally - there is just one truly unique weapon in the whole game - the exterminator mace.

I'm usually not a fan of roguelikes because starting back at zero when I die is never a desirable position to be in, as I simply do not have the time to keep starting from zero until I get that sweet combination of skill and luck. Slasher's Keep seems to be made for people like me in that sense because there is character progression, and dying doesn't feel like too much of a punishment. When you die you do lose a little bit of your character progression, but it doesn't take long to get back to where you were. The art, music, voices, sound effects, atmosphere, and occasional silliness all come together to deliver a truly unique and entertaining experience that keeps me coming back. 

Oh and one other thing, the parrying system in this game is incredible and adds a deep layer of tactical gameplay that really improves combat.

This game however has one major fatal flaw for me.It's extremely tedious and repetitive,it's not like many other roguelike games where you are pretty much guaranteed to win based on your skill level.Your character only loses part of it's perks and levels on death,meaning the game actually wants you to die countless times before making any good progress with each new character you start as.

Enemy scaling between the floors is absolutely terrible,that's where the fun gets sucked out of the game,you are going to be facing the same enemies over and over again and watch them grow absurdly in power while you remain largely the same.They will eventually have an enormous health pool and will mostly one-shot you,ending your run regardless of how far you made it in the game.

There are some things named item chutes on each floor,the items dropped inside them will be given back to you at the start of a new run.In theory it should work wonders when you have good equipment later in the game and you know you can't quite win yet.However starting with these items will only make you overpowered for the first few floors and enemies will still nearly one-shot you later.

It is fun, up to a point, but it's really too much work without much payoff in the long run. You'll basically run the first few levels over and over and over until you get enough levels, stats, and gear to make if farther. If you die, you lose about 25% of your levels and stats, as well as all of your gear. You do get to keep your skills, and they do help. You can save some gear for the future if you make it to a chute that sends gear to your future self. Kind of standard for a roguelike, but there are some problems.

1. It's really really easy to die, and it's not always because you played poorly. Getting one shot happens pretty often, no matter how many levels or the gear you have. This makes it easy to get caught in a loop, where you die, start a new game with reduced levels and stats, and bad gear. Then you die again almost immediately because you were undergeared and didn't have enough stats, and now you are even worse off than before. You can recover from this, but it takes a LOT of work and luck. 
2. The game isn't as smooth as you would think. It's too easy to get caught on the edge of things like steps, or barrels, or just a broken box. For a game that requires absolutely precision or else you'll get 1-2 shotted, that's not acceptable. You might even just step on or around something and get bounced up in the air. 
3. Eventually you run into plaforming/jumping puzzles. These are not fun. It's obvious they were put into the game to slow down progress, but they are frustrating. The lack of precision and control means you end up falling because you snagged something you didn't see, and you start the puzzle over.

I did have some fun playing the game, and when you are making progress, it's great. When you run into levels that are nothing but spike floors, jumping puzzles, and things like that, it's frustrating. If you play long enough and rack up enough skills, you'd likely be undefeatable, even if you died multiple times in a row, but the progress is too slow and frustrating for me. I like the first 1/3 and last 3/3 of the floors, but the middle ones are slogs that basically ruin the game.

During my playing of Slasher's keep I got very mixed feeling of it and felt like for every good feature the game also had a negative one.

Game's blocking mechanic is better than Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, but this game has only melee weapons and magic wands as your weapons.

You can craft weapons from different parts that you have collected during the run, but you rarely find a crafting station where you can do that.

Game has a leveling system, but only three (3) statics you upgrade. 

What finally got me lean towards giving a negative thumb was second boss. Not only does it have enormous amount of health, the fight doesn't change between runs and thus felt so boring I quit the game and felt done with the game.

At current there appear to be 2 bosses and 3 biomes in the regular story mode Slashers Keep, and although many of the enemies in later biomes are just reskins, there are some unique ones to keep you on your feet as time goes on.

When you beat the game, there is a lot more content to play (including unlockable characters), but I'm going to set it aside until full release, because I only have so much time.",1610878881,1610878881

Sure you have – maybe you’re involved in a few campaigns yourself, or perhaps learnt of its existence from a tiny little show called Stranger Things. It’s a game that inspired the whole RPG genre of video games and so much more besides, but to me it feels like the genre of roguelikes has remained remarkably untouched by its influence. Yes, I’m sure there’s a bunch of titles I don’t recall or know of that tap into that love of D&D, but as far as I'm aware none hold great mainstream appeal.  Enter Slasher’s Keep – a fantasy game all about fighting with swords and magic through randomly generated maps, traps and foes, all the while growing stronger in your attempts to escape the eponymous keep. 

For something that seems to wear such inspiration on its sleeve so clearly, it’s got to be good, right? In principle, sure, but it doesn’t take much playtime at all to realise that Slasher’s Keep is... Remarkably unrefined, to say the least. Let’s run through a few of the obvious offenders; the world itself is devoid of any real personality, as are the enemies you face – the latter taking the form of what almost looks like paper cut-outs that oddly float towards you before whacking you with noodle arms. When not noodling you to death, the enemies may choose instead to just bug out completely, ignoring you until the last second or getting caught on tiny bits of scenery. If it's not them getting snagged on things like bits of fence of broken box, it's you, which endlessly breaks the flow of the game. There’s basically no music, apart from an incessant little lute/guitar solo that is just about catchy enough to prevent complete insanity. Opening chests often see their contents fly out erratically, often down the nearest pit they can find... On and on I could go, but suffice to say, it’s not the best first impression.  

[h1]Diamonds in the Rough[/h1]

Persevere, though, and there are certainly mechanics and features beneath this grainy exterior that hold their own distinct charm. Blocking and parrying is one – it’s initially a confusing system, where merely holding a button is not enough. Instead, you have to turn to face the direction an attack comes from, which feels so alien to begin with. Get used to it, though, and it’s a nice twist to combat that ensures you keep at least some of your wits about you no matter the battle.  There’s also the item chutes you can find dotted around, where anything you surrender to them this run will be available to you at the start of the next. This becomes a matter of risk versus reward - do you dump all your gear in and basically sacrifice your run to assist in helping the next dash for glory? Or do you be stingy, potentially creating problems for future you? It’s your choice entirely. 

Being able to swing your item sack around to bounce opponents into pits and spikes for an instant kill is also pretty cool – difficult fights instantly become a lot easier with good positioning. While levelling up is an ancient concept, it too is still fun enough here; bash enough heads in and you can place points into strength, dexterity and intelligence, which only assist in the rapid bashing in of more heads. You’re also given the chance to retain one of the skills from your gear as a permanent boon, which range from the odd (decapitated heads explode) to the insanely good (the ability to deflect ranged attacks). Given a small amount of time and effort, mixing all these together make the first floors go from games of intricate battles patience where you constantly fight for your life, to mad dashes where it’ll be lucky if the bad guys get a good look at you before you turn them into a fine paste. 

This couples well with a system where rapidly chaining kills provides big boosts to the amount of experience points you get, and therefore the amount of levels and skills you can achieve.  This ends up shifting the dynamic over time into something which sees you blitzing through the early stages as fast as you can, chaining kills for the biggest payout. Becoming the medieval version of the Flash is in fact where I think the game excels the most – I can’t get enough of zooming down corridors, desperately seeking out my next kill as the bonus timer ticks down in the corner. 

Yet even when racing around with the wind and bits of zombie in your hair, that overall lack of polish keeps bringing things to a screaming halt. One occasion saw me just randomly fall through the floor, immediately ending my run and wiping out my progress – which, as you’ll soon find out, is a very bad thing. Another time the random map generation bugged out completely, leaving me with a floor I could thankfully still complete, but for which a good ninety percent (including all the goodies within) was completely blocked off to me. There’s also an odd issue with the difficulty balance, which spikes to an almost baffling degree if you manage to defeat the first boss and reach the second area. Even as I type I’m stuck there, in a section that honestly feels like the game is chastising me for doing too well. The loading screen for this level even alludes to having to grind this, seemingly asking you to put hours in for even the chance to progress onwards.  

[h1]The pitfalls of punishment[/h1]

It’s from this where the main, massive problem of Slasher’s Keep really rears its ugly head – it just feels too cruel and punishing. Every death not only loses your items, but also a remarkably large amount of the levels you’ve earned, dramatically staggering your ability to grow more powerful and proceed. Worse yet, this happens no matter where and when you die. On one recent occasion I lost a run to the tough as nails second area mere moments after entering it. A pain, make no doubt about it, but one I was willing to take the penalty for. Yet then, mere minutes later, my own clumsiness caused me to inadvertently  fall down a pit – as which point I was punished again, with practically the same severity, placing me in a position where I was actually weaker than when I had started playing [i]over an hour ago[/i].

In short, it fails to achieve the strange paradox which defines the best games of the roguelike genre – it fails to make losing fun. There’s no sense of accomplishment in a loss, no real sense that a lot of the time you invest has any value. It’s practically all of nothing, do or die, every single attempt you make. It’s an exhausting approach, and one that consistently threatens to wipe out my entire motivation to play. 

As such, this level of brutality and disregard for your efforts unfortunately couple with the other issues in play, making Slasher’s Keep a very difficult game to recommend. It’s a shame, because there are some really interesting ideas at play here, ones where I was willing to battle through the issues on more than one occasion to try and appreciate the gems within. But when this genre is so filled to the brim with instant classics, with more appearing all the time, it hardly seems worth the effort. This could stand among the greats given a fair bit more polish and refinement, sure. But as it stands? This isn’t really a keeper.",1610804737,1610804808

essentially requiring you to die and start from the beginning enough times to boost your stats high enough to be able to kill bosses in a reasonable timeframe (otherwise they would literally take you HOURS because you do so little damage, not to mention they would still one-shot you).

The dungeon generation isn't very complex and the enemies aren't very interesting, in fact, I'd go so far as to say that this game has some of the most generic enemies I have EVER seen in a game, which wouldn't be as much of an issue if you didnt fight the same 4 enemies over and over.

It's a shame because this game actually has/had the potential to be an incredibly deep and entertaining rougelike dungeon-crawler, but it is unfortunately too mundane and poorly balanced to provide a satisfying gameplay loop, especially considering the game expects you to be grinding stats AS SOON AS YOU START THE FIRST LEVEL.

The premise is simple, you are a prisoner locked in a very shabby but ever changing dungeon. Every time you start the game, go to a new floor or die the levels shift. Enemies roughly stay consistent with each floor but the layouts, trap placement, special rooms, secrets all shift and change each time.

Dying isn't that big of a deal but it does punish you in a few lost levels, coin, all your items and of course starting back at floor 1. Permadeath is a option if you really like that extra thrill.

After the first level all the monsters become sword sponges, and I cannot get past level 4, which is a boss I have gone against about a half dozen times, and there is nothing you can do to beat this thing from what I can tell other than pure cheese. 

Having your stats reduced every single time you die, and the gear you find at the start not scale is also really annoying, and once it clicks that you're just running your head into a wall over and over, it makes you realize there really isn't anything here to keep you playing the game.

Because the game is great, i just don't really like it all that much.
Controls are great, combat is great, visuals and sound are great, soundtrack is great, but the actual gameplay loop of this game is atrocious. 

In most Rogue-Lite/ke on death you lose everything but the new knowledge you came away with. Slasher's Keep changes that by making it so that you only lose items you haven't put into storage, and a few level-up points (but never all of them) and you can also ""Perma-Learn"" certain buffs and abilities.

They however entirely failed to balance this in a way that is fun. In most other games of this sort that would simply mean that the game gets easier every time you play it. Unfortunately in this case instead of just having that as a fun game mechanic they counteracted it by having each floor be 10x harder than the last. And even more unfortunate is the fact that this game's idea of difficulty is a numbers game. The numbers go up but the game stays the same.

You die 10 times to make it through the first floor, then you reach the second and get killed in one hit, so you die 10 times to make it through the second floor, then you reach the third and get killed in one hit, so you die 10 times to make it through the third floor, then you reach the fourth and get killed in one hit. This is the entire game. Naturally the same goes for your armour and weapons, which usually only stay relevant for one or two deaths, leaving you absolutely no chance to become attached to anything, further making each life and death more miserable. It's like Destiny, you're given precisely 15 minutes to enjoy your new equipment before it's instantly made useless by the first thing you pick up on the next floor.

This entirely removes the potential ""god run"" you stay excited for in literally any other rogue-like/te. There's no feeling of ""this is the one!"" because every time you play you know full well you're just going to further the game the exact same amount as you did last time. If you just keep playing you'll win.

I'd like to say i'll probably keep going and finish it because the combat is actually great, but who knows. I'm currently up to the 5th out of 10 floors and all of a sudden there's awful platforming and the end of levels being hidden behind ""secrets"" so it's up in the air.

Pros that make it all worth it:[list]
[*] art style
[*] atmosphere
[*] combat
[*] progression
[*] crafting
[*] movement (for the most part)
[/list]

Cons that ruin your day:[list]
[*] everything in the “pros” column is designed and executed at 20-60% of what a great game would’ve had
[/list]

There’s a lot of irreverence to the design of Slasher’s Keep. Despite looking and feeling like a game jam demo cobbled together in 48 hours, it’s a finished experience with a more or less complete story, a random level generator (that glues premade rooms together), several playable characters, (awfully balanced) skill, progression, combat and crafting systems and a teeny-tiny soundtrack. 

One of the game’s best parts is that it barely goes beyond the basics of the very first level of the dungeon. I swear, it’s a pro even if it doesn’t sound like it. The game very slowly ramps up the complexity of gameplay, but the formula largely stays the same: if you’re overpowered, rush in and annihilate everything; if you’re not, use your wand, lure individual enemies out and spike them.

Some of the design choices are so bad that it boggles the mind: from innocent ones like the hideous font found on the stat sheet and on crafted weapons to far worse ones like the skill and stat systems where the balance flies out the window in 20+-level dungeons, to outright weird stuff like the enemy design: like, why the fuck do you fight loincloth-wearing naked molerats next to zombies, imps, goo balls and levitating skulls? Simply because the creator found the wordplay of them no longer being naked funny? I mean, seriously.

The thing is, all these issues combined cannot outweigh the sheer fun of spiking yet another zombie or shooting a chain lightning that jumps six times and clears the room, or smacking open a supply crate and finding a +30 to Strength Liquid Ember. Despite its many flaws, the game delivers way more fun than one could typically buy with the money it costs. I got my 100% achievements and will take a break from Slasher’s Keep for a bit, but I know that a month or a year from now, I’m coming back for more.",1610098728,1610098764

This game has amazing potential and is one of the coolest roguelike games I've played, but constant bugs, cheap one shots that kill runs, and ridiculous enemy scaling is keeping this game from true greatness. 

Yes, you can make it through this game, but it is torturous - and not in a good way - in a ""why did my run end from a one shot I couldn't even see?!"" kind of way. 

The roguelike Loop is enjoyable too, but overly punishing in an attempt to artificially extend the length of the game. You loose 25% of your stats every time you die. That means you could work 20 hours to build your character, then hit a streak of bad luck and see all your hard work completely destroyed. ""But what about permanent perks?"", you might say. Well, most of them unequivocally suck or are ""build"" specific (e.g. things meant for Ranged builds over Melee). There are some REALLY good perks, but they are harder to come by. 

I do like punishing RL games. I have 174 hours in Dead Cells at Boss Cell 4, but this game has yet to find the sweet spot between challenging and tedious.

I really wanted to like Slasher's Keep but unfortunately the combat is boring and clunky.
The controls and movements are way too floaty and unresponsive, it really feels akward to play.
The level design is not very good and the minimap doesn't help, it's a mess, kinda annoying to say the least...
Slasher's Keep also seems to be very unbalanced from what i've played...

Oh btw there's no keys rebinding while in game, it's also impossible to pause while playing, so have fun getting killed while your browsing your inventory or have to go idle.
Honestly i don't understand how can you release a game out of early access without these basic features ?

I'm usually very tolerant for indie titles but this one didn't worked for me.
I'll go back to Ziggurat 2 and Nightmare Reaper. 😉

It's not entirely garbage, i like the artstyle, creatures design and the musics but overall the experience is more frustrating and boring than enjoyable.
If you love fps roguelike and can tolerate clunky controls and boring combat maybe give it a try...

Couldn't resist one more shot..fortunately the save file stood up and I beat the game. A crash or two, which is emblematic of the suspect save system and state of the game.

Do not let Slasher's Keep's cute charming exterior fool you, this is a fun, fresh, dungeon crawler that offers an addictive single player experience. Its combat mechanics are great. Beyond the close quarters ""slash, strike, and parry"" swordplay, wizard wands offer ranged combat and your environment offers the opportunity to ""Home Alone"" your enemies. In combination with procedural generation, looting offers replayability by ensuring you will never have the same load out twice. It is also great how you can bring looted components to a blacksmith and make your own weapons. In terms of difficulty, play throughs will definitely challenge you and the addition of a permadeath makes it all the more intense. The game's high level of polish and attention to detail, includes a genuine sense of humour too. I always crack a smile when my character audibly ""chomps"" bugs off the dungeon floor to regenerate health.

The issues I have with this game is that you need to unlock the characters and customization and that with the system it uses, if you have the game set up incorrectly, your mouse won't align with the game, this isn't a problem really as all you need to do is set the game to your screen size, for me it worked with just using direct 3D instead but the reason I'm complaining about this is because my brother is an idiot when it comes to computers and when he played this (he uses a different computer) he was nagging me a ton to fix it. I also feel like there should be a teleport system in the game since running across the entire map to sell some shit is really annoying. I believe it would be a good idea to add an upgrade that increases your inventory size so this isn't as painful. I feel there should also be a setting to make it where you can find the weapons you made in chests or after bosses, or even in the shop. This game I would say is easily one of the top dungeon crawlers of 2020 and it has a simple move set, however there are a lot extra things in it, such as how the end lag on the super attack is extremely high on maces, and make using the super a more situational thing than normal so you only want to use it to finish/ one shot enemies. 9/10, would bang",1609154470,1609154470

The problem is not the combat difficulty curve or platforming, as this is clearly intentional.

The main problem is the physics of the game. You can try to walk up some stairs or navigate a room while being chased by enemies, but if there is an inch high bump in the ground u cannot walk over it. I understand getting caught on huge boxes that are placed purposely, but not the tiny fragments of the box that remain when u destroy it. It feel super janky to even move around in this game and feels even worse when you die because of something out of your control. For example, I sent some crafting stuff down the chute for my next run as i was looking for a handle for my mace head i found, got to floor 2 and somehow glitched inside one of the little metal cages that are sometimes around with a hollow inside. Couldn't get out, run ruined, lost everything. 

No problem, I caught up to where i was found some new good gear. Climbing the tower to my new personal best. Hit floor 6, enemies scaling hard now so I'm cautiously scoping out each room before entering. Oh wait, the metal doors closed on me and I'm stuck in a wall dying to skulls.

It almost feels like the world is made up of drawings that an orc or some other monster in a fantasy setting like this would draw on parchment. The music is also low key in an appealing way; its just kind of cool, intentionally crude atmosphere that's appealing. 

Unfortunate though every indie game ever has to be a roguelike for some reason so rather than this cool low fi atmosphere being used on, say, some kind of Ultima Underworld style immersive sim type experience with a handcrafted world with memorable locations you're going through a mindless maze of bland, interchangeable rooms over and over and over again until you get bored of it because the game has shown you all its cards and you realize how pointless the randomization makes things.

I guess I still recommend it but I really wish developers would chill out on the roguelikes. Slasher's Keep has an easy mode option and an option to keep skills when you die. I'm starting to see a lot of roguelikes that offer options like this to soften the blow of the general, why not just cut to the chase and not make your game a roguelike?

The control aren't fit at all for any kind jumping (to add more, you barely jump, get stuck everywhere when you jump like on platform border that doesn't make any sense, move somewhat slowly and doesn't have much air control, it's floaty, there isn't enough feedback), and the jumping puzzle are just annoying ""timed precise jump"" in long session when sometime harsh punishment if you fail at any point.

They break the pace of the game, they are way too much of them as they come one after another.

They aren't interesting or engaging. It's something you are forced to do to progress, doesn't feel any better than a timer in a free mobile game. Feel like it's here just to be annoying and that's it.

-You instead repeatedly drive-by guys. You get stuck to the side of a prop or the corner of a railing and take damage.

76561197978007654,598060,True,0,0,0,1504,1504,233,7,"Slasher's Keep takes a distinctive art style, a slow-paced rogue-lite room-by-room puzzle action game loop, and a novel progression system and packages it together for a fine stand-out title that is worth the jank before eventually going stale.  Get it on sale and it'll be worth it for about 20 hours of game play mindless enough that you can still listen to podcasts (if you do that).

The central premise is you start at the deepest part of a dungeon, start with almost nothing, and have to work your way up 10 procedurally generated floors (for your first playthrough; after winning once you can set it for more).  Between floors you get a little snippet of your character's story and motivation (there are different characters, but between the main two and one additional secret character I've played the only difference in game play is one starting skill), and at the end you confront the big bad who put you in the dungeon in the first place.  

Combat is almost entirely melee, with some wands providing ammo limited and anemic ranged fire for special circumstances.  The melee itself is somewhat Mount & Blade-ish, with directional parrying and a slow pace.  One annoying piece of jank is that the 2D sprites don't adjust to verticality well, so fighting enemies on stairs can mean either you or the enemy will whiff a lot.  I wish the player's range on their swings were increased slightly as I found the extremely limited reach frustrating to work around at times (not even with combat, really, but smashing pots and striking things on the ground).  You are limited to one hand weapons that range from fast and weak knives to slow and powerful maces (I believe they all have the same in-game range), as your other hand is carrying your inventory in a bag which doubles as your ""knock-back"" move.  You'll depend on this a lot when you're under-leveled as knocking enemies into spikes is an instant kill.  While it does make the game more immersive, as trying to get an attacker off you by smacking them with a bag is closer to your average gamer's irl defensive skills, I think the game would be well served by not requiring you to completely complete an attack with your weapon before throwing the bag out there.  Being an even-or choice means you'll either be fencing someone if your weapon is powerful or waiting for the right time with the bag if not, because using one means you won't be prepared to use the other in a more dynamic way.

For any rogue-lite, figuring out how to do progression is a key game design question, and here I think Slasher's Keep shines.  There are a lot of different skills, all technically passive but colorful, a crafting system, and of course the standard leveling and loot-grabbing.  When you are defeated, you get sent back to your cell and lose some levels, ability points, and any skills you haven't ""perma-learned"".  Skills are either awarded randomly on leveling in a run, or from the weapons you are carrying.  Periodically, on a level up you'll get a point to perma-learn or upgrade a skill.  But the best part is the item chutes on some level.  Throw an item down the chute and it'll be ready for your next run from the start.  While backsliding levels and items from a run of bad luck is possible, if you're smart and drop off weapons and armor as they you get better things, the early floors will become a breeze (but exp rewards scale with your level, so it's still worth having fun and going on a long killing spree before climbing).

There are three biomes as you climb, standard dungeon to start, aristocratic mansion at the end, but the second is maybe my biggest complaint about the game.  Artistically, it's more of a ""booby-trapped pyramid"" sort of feel, which already doesn't make a lot of sense compared to the other two, but no one really cares about the art style making sense with this sort of game.  The game play is very different for the middle floors, with traps *everywhere*, with swinging blades, timed floor spikes, and even some platforming (sometimes above said spikes, which do not insta-kill but are a very frustrating way to end a run if they do get you), all with enemies included.  There is no fall damage, so there is that, but it's a very different feel than what you thought you were signing up for after the first few floors, and honestly, I was always just trying to get powerful enough that I could get past them before I started enjoying myself again.  It's much worse if you're not getting great frame-rates for crisp inputs, as I wasn't before switching to a low graphics setting (which could be a complaint in and of itself: my machine can run modern Doom, albeit at a sluggish pace; I wouldn't have expected a repeat of that experience with game looking like this).

All in all, Slasher's Keep is impressive for a one-man operation, with some good ideas thrown in with its more obvious limitations.  Good for some non-serious time-killing.

My one biggest complaint that the dev could easily fix is this: make the map's coloring more clear.

Nifty lo-fi first-person-slasher roguelite. You're a prisoner in an orcish dungeon and you have to fight your way out from the bottom floor. Each time you ""die"", the orcs capture you and throw you in the dungeon, where you lose your gear and a level or two but get to keep your skills and any items that you hid in a drop-chute.

Instead you could rather just thrust at the enemies and run away then thrust ran at them and repeat you do more damage that way anyways and you knock them back but if you swing attack your gonna take damage. Also instead of parrying by blocking in the direction of where the enemy is going to hit you why can't you also attack where the enemy is going to hit to and by doing so countering that attack. Maybe the game can work on these things as I know it only came out not too long ago.

Another issue I have is that it displays my Nvidia Gefore stats rather poor as in the fps counter for some reason can't be moved exactly where I want it and then I can only see an fps counter if I use the DX 9 version of the game and not just the normal game it want even let me put the fps counter on let alone see the the Geforce  kinda weird in my opinion that aspect could use some more work.",1607808319,1607808319

[list]

[*]There is a learning curve. You cannot win on your first try. You're going to have to learn the rules of this game's universe and how combat works, which is very different from most other roguelikes. Some tips I have if you've just bought the game would be to not concern yourself with winning on the current run, but how you can best prepare your future runs for success. This strategy lessens the crushing defeat of dying on ""the run"" to something stupid or easily preventable. Additionally, focus on surviving and minimizing damage taken rather than killing your enemy as quickly as possible. Taking time on encounters might teach you more about how to consistently kill something rather than trying to sloppily murder it and never attempt to parry.

[*]THERE IS SO MUCH IN THIS GAME. After beating the first ascension and making a new character, i was floored at the sheer upper limit on how many floors you can add to a run (close to 200!!!!), no pun intended. There's unique items that I haven't found yet, wand types I've never found, perks I've never tried, and honestly so many different permutations that I likely will never find, and that's a huge plus for a roguelike trying to break into an extremely saturated genre. They're all interesting, too, which is mostly a result of an extremely satisfying combat system involving dodging, parrying, knockbacks, consumable items, and interesting enemy design plus procedurally generated environments and traps that add peril and excitement to every room and hallway. The way permanent progression works with sending items down chutes to your future runs and permanently learning perks plus stat increases is very satisfying. If you really hate yourself, you can play a hardcore version where there's no progression between runs.

[*]This game offers something wholly unique in the roguelike genre and it's a first person perspective in a dungeon crawler. These kinds of games fell off in popularity and its a lovely setting that I hold pretty close to my heart. If you like games like Legend of Grimrock, this might be right up your alley.

[*]There are some minor annoyance I have with movement and collision, notably certain enemies explode or drop their body parts and they can actually prevent you from moving through them. The first boss of the game is pretty large, and one time its corpse blocked my from entering the next area because the dead body prevented me from being able to access the door. A minor grievance that forced me to reload a save, so nothing too major, but it can be an issue for some if you're unlucky. Theres also [spoiler] parkour puzzles... The game's floaty movement and jumping make for some frustrating moments when you fail these, and you'll often feel like it's no fault of your own. Just push through them and you'll get to the good parts.[/spoiler]

[*]I think the base types of weapons are cool and interesting. There are certain perks related to these weapon types and some are far better than others. My biggest grievance is how cool wands felt to use but how impossible it was to make them your main weapon. They have this DOOM-esque feel to them, where each magical element maps to a different type of gun that you can literally aim down sights with. You can snipe floating skulls from across the room with arcane magic, or shotgun a ghoul in the face with frost magic and it feels really gratifying, but they operate with a limited ammo system that places strict restrictions on how much you can use them. Perks can alleviate this, but not enough to the point where they become a main weapon to use, and I'd like to see this changed in the future.

[*]Spoilers on boss fights ahead. [spoiler]When you first load into the floor for the spider boss and fight them for the first time, it is an incredibly imposing feeling that you never really get to feel more than once. I feel like this was a missed opportunity further down the line, especially when I found that there was no boss for the second ""area"", and only at the very final floor would I find a new boss that I actually managed to beat on my first try (the gimmick for the final boss is environmental and not really reliant on having good stats or items). Maybe the masochist in me is wrong on this one, but more bosses and more difficulty could've gone a long way towards making each run build up to something engaging.[/spoiler]

[*] The sound design in this game is so perfect for what it's trying to accomplish. Slashing a ghoul's head off sounds meaty. Blasting someone with a frost wand shotgun is loud and impactful. The voice acted shopkeeper's timid and weird voice fits him so unbelievably well; it really does sound like a naked mole rat if it could talk. The soundtrack is filled with these plucky, mellow guitar strums that create this weird mix of coziness and tension, and each area has its own themes and instruments that really come together to create engaging environments that you won't forget.
[/list]

Slasher's Keep is a game that, if given enough time and attention, might be something that you can end up sinking hundreds of hours into. It's a fascinating, unique, and charming roguelike in a genre that feels like everyone is trying to reinvent the wheel in. This game keeps things simple but changes up the base formula just enough that the final result is something special. However, it's not for everyone, and you're likely going to find that out for yourself after the two-hour refund time limit has expired. If you enjoy hand to hand Dark Souls-y melee combat, loot generative FPS games like Borderlands, or are just looking for a roguelike to consume some of your time, give this game a shot and it could really suck you in. There's no harm in trying out the base game for a few floors and seeing how it feels. You might really enjoy it",1607484827,1607484827

In this game, increasing your level is not treated as a reward you get for defeating difficult bosses, it's treated as an integral part of gameplay, requiring the player slog through every earlier level to get just enough exp to equip slightly better gear and actually have a chance in the RNG based level design. 

This game has a really low skill cap; once you learn to take every enemy in a 1v1, the only thing left to learn is how to bait every enemy into a 1v1. 1v2s are possible, but use the exact same skills you'd use in a 1v1, just faster. However, if you fight a group of enemies large enough to recharge their attacks before you can get a hit in, there's nothing you can do if you don't have any items. The possibility of getting swamped and straight up losing regardless of skill level is a frustrating aspect of this game that is largely luck (bad luck if the room layout is like that) based. You can, of course, win in these situations if your strength is high enough to one hit everyone, or if your dexterity is high enough to make their hits do little to no damage to you, but that's about it. 

Slasher's Keep also discourages kiting by making backwards movement about 1/4 as slow as forwards movement (sideways movement is about 1/2 as slow), and the lack of a skill tree in place of randomly receiving perks discourages players from playing with specific builds in mind. The combat is also somewhat bland. Wands will be massively underpowered until you can get to a higher level, at which point your build will be focused around melee weapons. There are a few different attacks for each melee weapon, but there is no reason to use anything other than a quick light attack. Given this information, you'll probably assume that combat will benefit the fastest melee weapon. 

There is one overwhelmingly good strategy; put all your points in intelligence until the amount of points you lose on death is equal to the amount of points you gained. After this, just put all of your points evenly into strength and dexterity, until you can equip better gear. This is the fastest way to play because points put in intelligence increase your exp yield and allow you to level faster. The game does not have level locks (situations where you are not allowed to enter an area because your level is too low) electing instead for gear locks--you will frequently be put in situations where you can no longer progress because your gear isn't good enough. This however, is an indirect level lock; any gear that isn't worthless requires a minimum number of points in strength, dexterity, or intelligence; this is a horrible yet deliberate design choice that forcibly slows player progression until they level up. 

Slasher's Keep took a steep skill curve and replaced it with a logarithmic grind curve and thought nobody would notice. It has a low skill cap; once you hit it the only way to get better is through increasing your level. It discourages different play styles by removing a skill tree and replacing it with RNG based skill progression. As a result, there is only one good way to play--put all your points in intelligence. Despite these gripes, I would be lying if I said the game was all bad. The weapon creation is clever and the art is highly stylized.",1607395247,1607395247

Love the oblivion style combat and directional blocking. 

Many of the mechanics are well thought out. Particularly the shoot mechanic where you pass down items to your next life after you die. If you keep this mechanic in mind, when you die you can easily fly back through floors depending on how far up you get. I also like how you can lock any ability you find if you have a stat point. It allows you to prioritise how you want to play, although I feel you are strong armed into getting at least some life steal (the abilities Golden tongue and Deflect are game changers if you can get them as well). I also love that ultimately your mind is this strongest weapon in this game. Almost every combat situation, including bosses, can be defeated regardless of whether you have really good gear. 

The DIY crafting style is unique and fresh. Great idea that I hope gets fleshed out more, and taken up by other games.

I really love the janky, retro, highish fantasy atmosphere of the game that does not take itself too seriously. The music is a truely excellent component of this. I usually turn off music in video games which require a high degree of focus, but not in this one. The orc posters are a hilarious touch as well.

BE WARNED: this game punishes mistakes brutally and swiftly. A few of my deaths were from bugs (i.e. imps hitting me through walls etc) but i'm sure they will be fixed. It can be a very frustrating game at times, but it usually always rewards patience and planning. The traps in the game are your biggest enemy IMO. They hit extremely hard (entire health bar) if your gear/armour is under-leveled for the floor, particularly the black/purple orbs. Be careful! 


Suggestions:

IMO this game could really use a teleport system, similar to Enter the Gungeon. You spend a lot of time retracing back to the exit. 

Also it does suffer slightly from a lack of enemy types. I think there a 7 types off the top my head, with variations on the theme within each type. I would have really like to have seen a whole new class of enemy in each biome, or perhaps just more enemy types in general. More bosses would be amazing as well. On the way to the final boss, there is only one other boss! I hope he keeps supporting this game, or adds DLC. Would 100% buy it.

Also, i never really gelled with the wand system until much much later in the game when I realised how good kinetic wands are. The whole ammo system really put me off at first but i guess its necessary to balance it out. I think an added magic system with mana (which would be a very rare resource), independent of wands, could be awesome, from summoning lightening or fireballs with your hands, to weird quirky stuff, like creating ice patches on the floor for enemies to slide into pits or spikes, or turning them into chickens etc. 

Perhaps the combat is a bit too simplistic. The ability to crouch would be cool to duck under blows etc. Enemies with unblockable, but well-telegraphed high or low strikes could had an extra level of complexity to the combat. i.e. duck high strikes, jump over low strikes. A quick but short ranged side step with a hefty cool down would be a nice addition as well. The molerat's haymaker move only counter seems to be running around wildly or smacking with the sack. This side step would a graceful but rewarding mechanic I feel.

Anyway...

Overall, a very impressive game with bucket loads of potential. 9/10

Yes!
This charming little dungeon crawler from Damian Schloter has pretty much consumed my last nearly two weeks. And I'll go over why this may be just the game for you or not. That's ultimately up to you to decide.

[b] What is Slasher's Keep? [/b]
Slasher's Keep is a first person dungeon crawler done in the style of old school shooters and RPG's from the 90's. Games like Doom, Wolfenstein, the Shining series and so on. You play a prisoner tasked with escaping through a dreaded keep to find your sister. This is accomplished in a roguelite style formula where you do ""runs"" through the dungeons levels gaining loot and leveling up your character. The ultimate goal is to gain enough permanent belongings and stats before you perish and must restart to give it another go.

[b] What makes the game unique? [/b]
The way the game handles its combat and it's progression systems are something we really haven't seen a ton of in modern gaming. The combat plays similar to Mount & Blade with targeted striking and parrying your opponents. You must learn their patterns and tackle each fight on their terms. Regarding the progression systems there is so much to cover, so I will simplify. You can both find and buy powerful gear for your character as well as occasionally gain enough materials to craft your own weapons. Every level you can increase your primary attributes of strength, dexterity, and intelligence. Every few levels you are able to select a skill you have gotten from gear to permanently learn (meaning it follows you into your next life as well) gaining momentum into future runs. I will also briefly note that the game contains way more content than your first ""completion"" will showcase. This is something those familiar with roguelites will be understand.

[b] ""Okay buddy, TLDR. Gimme the score and stuff"" [/b]
I highly recommend this game 100%.

I would say that Slasher's Keep, while rough in spots and far from non-janky, is one of the highlights in gaming this year for me. And if you aren't sure whether or not to get the game yourself yet after reading this. Do be sure to check out some of the gameplay from streamers and youtubers to finalize your choice. I personally am playing it on youtube and twitch, to shamelessly plug myself. Find me @PentaHybrid on all social media if you have interest or any questions on the game.

Took to long to type so heres a bullet list:
-Fun for the first playthough
-because of how stats are handled after you die and how xp gains scale with you, if you just keep throwing yourself at the game you are granuteed to win.
-1st boss, use a gimick to defeat it, still a neat fight
-final boss, would have been intresting if the npc didnt annoyingly tell you exactly what to do over and over again, also you cant damage her, you have to use a gimick again. Makes the fight just a waiting game
-the platforming sections only really deduct from the gamplay
-wands are only useful to get out of potential softlocks by enemies who fly
-honestly all of the flying enemies feel out of place for such a melee based game, all of them cause issues such as the skulls making you wait forever, killing streaks, and mosquitos flying way over ledges you cant reach forcing you to use a wand
-POST GAME CONTENT
-if you chose the same character its just back to floor one but the enemies do way more damage and has various bugs such as taking 32 damage but having to heal 270
-other characters are neat, but its still the same gameplay. the only diffrence is a single skill you get at the start and the ""story""

However, there's not much variation, wonky physics, you get stuck in objects/walls, ""secrets"" (There's legit only 1 real secret in the game) and puzzles are mandatory and fairly boring, horrible UI (map's hard to navigate, font is hard to read, can't scroll skillbook etc.), parrying doesn't always register or the monster swings through a wall, melee monsters sometimes hit you from afar, ranged enemies are sometimes untouchable, only a handful of monsters with some variations, and there's only two bosses in the entire game... there's 3 biomes tho...

You can replay the game, but there's really no point. You just get more of the same loot and fight the same enemies (which are again just variations of enemies from previous floors). There's a few unique skills that you can find on legendary/unique items, but they are far and few in between.

Crafting is cool. Parrying is cool when it works. The first boss was interesting to fight. The game is very charming. Skill system is interesting.

While I still think this game was released out of early access a little too early, I think there's enough really good things to outweigh the bad.  This game is a true-to-its-roots dungeon crawler, with tons of gameplay and mechanics to make it very interesting.  It has a unique art style, and while everything in the game is a bit janky, it's part of the charm.  If you like rogue-lites, dungeon crawlers, or just any sort of fantasy games, I encourage you to pick it up!

That being said, you almost certainly will encounter a game-breaking bug at some point that will ruin one of your runs.  The dev is patching this regularly though, so hopefully those become less frequent.  On top of that, there is a bit of first person platforming in the middle of the game, and it takes awhile to get the hang of it.  Once you've figured it out, you can breeze through it, but I strongly believe that no one actually enjoys first person platforming, and developers need to stop.

Otherwise, it's a great game; the original experience will probably take you 15-30 hours, and there's a good bit of replay value.  Definitely one of my favorite games of 2020, and one of my favorite rogue-lites of all time.",1607132269,1607534592

I dont remember how it was when I started but I think once you complete the dungeon then you can decide how many lvls you want your keep to be 10 to infinite and Im sure its just gonna be the same 4 different layouts.

The game is pretty dope. Super neat combat with a pretty art style that kept me playing. My only issue, which is one I've seen bouncing around for a bit, are the platforming sections in the later areas. They're not terrible, I certainly find them doable. My issue with them is that for some reason my character will get stuck in or on the platforms and not let me move until they retract, sending me falling to the floor and resetting all the progress that I made. Forcing me to go back up and more than likely have it happen all over again. I feel like those sections are a bit too unforgiving for how clunky it all feels while I'm doing it. I can't really comment on the later sections, as those same platforming sections where I keep getting to now continue to ruin any fun I have and I just end up getting myself killed so I can go play the earlier sections where the only issues I have with collision is sometimes getting caught on a box or fence.

The RPG systems here are robust and there are a ton of different skills to mix and match to create a unique character. The way progression works is pretty unique: while there is a Permadeath mode that makes SK into a true Rogue-like, most players will want to play on Normal, where there are a couple key methods of progression. Primarily, you only lose a percentage of your money, stats, and XP when you die, so eventually you'll be starting your runs on level 10 with 20 of each stat, compared to 2 of each on a fresh spawn. The other big one is the item chutes: every floor after the first has a chute that will deposit items back in the room you start in. So basically, as long as you make it to a chute, you can always send back your second-best weapon to give you a big headstart on the next run. Combine all this with the fact that enemy XP rewards scale based on your own level, and after several runs on the same character, you will be steamrolling through the early floors one-shotting enemies -- which is still fun and rewarding thanks to the Combo system which rewards you with extra XP for killing enemies quickly.

There are some definite rough edges: the flying Moth enemies run away from you which can lead to very annoying situations where they can't be hit, the inventory management can be a pain thanks to the lack of a PUBG-style loot menu, instead you have to sift through everything on the floor, and there are first-person jumping puzzles, which I personally love but I've seen lots of people complaining about. The physics engine also feels endearingly janky, which can sometimes lead to you getting tripped up on small objects, and can make the jumping puzzles less fun.

It scratches that itch for dungeon crawling, player upgrading, and a great game play loop all at once. I recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of rougelikes and rpg elements, it does have a little jank but nothing that isn't to hard on the player. I guess I should specify, there is points in the game where you require a silver key to progress, sometimes you will be on a floor for 10-30 minutes looking for it, you don't know if its behind the secret door which is on almost every level or on an enemy or what have you sometimes it takes a little longer than you would like and that may put some people off if they are looking to do a ""Quick Run"" that just isn't the game, its long, even on the smallest length dungeon which is 10 floors. After you have completed the game you have the ability to continue and even extend how far the dungeon goes, all the way to infinite. Now I really like this about the game but if you die in one of these post-game dungeons you generate, you might as well kiss that character goodbye as even the equipment you throw down the item chute for your next life will seemingly not be enough to balance out the difficulty. Some maps can be confusing and specifically the floors right after the first boss, and i think that this section is really the meat of your play through as everytime I've gotten to the next section after that its a cake walk to the final boss. I really enjoy the game and it may not seem like it but some of these things are kind of what gives it its charm.

Pros:
Has a fun amount of mechanical fun with the knockback and inventory sack mechanics, making terrain just as effective as a normal weapon, given the right ingenuity.

Killstreak mechanic means that skilled players can reap much better benefits with proper routing, and makes speeding through the early game feel like you're an insane adventurer whirlwinding through their initial escape.

Crafting your own weapon is very satisfying, and you can get attached to the PERFECT weapon that you want to keep around forever, making deaths a little more personal.


Cons:
The actual physic mechanics leave a lot to be desired, a decapitated enemies head poses the same physics as a gigantic barrel, in the fact that it stops you in your tracks and forces you to shove it.

The spikes in difficulty are a little too pronounced to feel good, i.e. going from area 1 to area 2, enemies go from dealing about 15% of your HP to 75% in one hit. Either armor values need to be bumped up in the later stages of area 1, or enemy damage values need to be toned down in early area 2. 

Wands are hard to like. Obviously the game is more worried about the melee, since it's SLASHER's Keep after all, but so far I feel like the Lightning Wand and Kinetic Wand are the only usable ones, the others just simply dont deal enough damage, have too low projectile speed, or are too inaccurate.




Overall, I can see a lot of potential in it, it just needs a few tweaks here and there, maybe eventually some workshop/developer support for new weapons, enemies, areas, and more would make this game 10/10",1606702860,1606702860

The number of bugs and balancing issues that exist in the game's current state make progression touch-and-go at best, and genuinely impossible at worst, and force closing the game every time you get stuck cuz of buggy platforms or falling through floors during challenge rooms is... well, it's not fun. 

On top of the bugs, the difficulty curve between BEFORE the first boss and AFTER is a bit excessive. Enemies end up having enough health to make it tedious as opposed to challenging to fight them, especially with the hitboxes that can be imprecise at times.

Lastly, platforming wasn't a great choice for this game. There's no drop shadow and the player hitbox tends to get stuck on the edges of platforms; alongside the relatively imprecise movement controls, this causes you to slip off of platforms more often than you should.

[b]THE GOOD:[/b]
[list]
  [*]Stylish, faux-retro look. A little janky, but ok for an indie game.

  [*]Pretty nice variety of loot, both in stats and in looks.

  [*]A large amount of skills to choose from.

  [*]Pleasant soundtrack.
[/list]

[b]THE NEUTRAL:[/b]
[list]
  [*]A system that saves some of your progression on death. It's a standard idea in roguelites, but this implementation is balanced in a way that very much corners you into building a character over MANY deaths to amass some permanent skills and a good selection of items, which you have virtually no chance of acquiring in a single life.

  [*]Some skills are pretty much mandatory to succeed, while others just outright suck. It feels like the useful skills like blocking the projectiles, faster attacks or better crafting should be either a basic mechanic or much more readily available.

  [*]Stats are heavily skewed in usefulness towards strength. Intelligence only modestly boosts your XP, and dex is an outright scam, only useful as a prerequisite to equipping stuff.
[/list]

[b]THE BAD:[/b]
[list]
  [*]Very harsh difficulty spike mid-game to late-game, which makes you either play absolutely flawlessly (because otherwise most enemies just two tap you), or, as mentioned, grind your character to the point when you have superior gear, stats and skills, and you can still lose most of that in an unfortunate death.

  [*]Melee combat gets repetitive very quickly. Slash-parry-counterattack, slash-parry-counterattack, slash-parry-counterattack with an occasional bash against some enemies. Yes, you can instakill enemies with a bash into spikes, but they are not always readily available.

  [*]Wands pretty much suck balls. Even worse, investing skill points into making them better doesn't even pay off that much, they still remain bad with how little damage they do, how little ammo they have and how underwhelming the effects of most of them are.

  [*]AI. Boy oh boy, is it terrible. I'm not talking about the enemies being predictably stupid and getting stuck all the time in various props, I'm fine with that, since it's a low-budget game. I'm talking about the intentional design of some flying enemies that either just back off and hang above a deadly chasm, unreachable with melee (remember, wands suck), and lobbing infinite shots at you. Nothing is less fun than being locked in a room, trying to lure a bug into a melee range or waiting until a flying skull finally aggroes on you.

  [*]Level generation in general. The rooms get repetitive quite soon, which makes the gameplay stale and boring. Some of the rooms are pure bullsh*t (like a spiked ceiling one), especially the first time you encounter them. Quite frequently you need to find a ""secret"" just to complete the floor, which makes absolutely no sense. Do you know what a secret in a video game means? It means optional content.

  [*]Some of the ""secret"" content in this game centers around jumping sections with timed platforms. And OH MY GOD, this is the worst part of the game bar none. Not only the jumps feel floaty and hard to control (you can still get used to that), the collision physics are pure garbage. Get ready for your ankles or head to get clipped in a platform, which results in starting over. That, coupled with a terrible platforming room design can just make you stuck at a jumping section forever. After several dozens of attempts on one such a room (which was a mandatory ""secret"" one), I just had to uninstall.
[/list]


In summary, this game still feels rough, unbalanced and kind of barebone, like it's still in early access, and I was surprised to discover that it was in released state. For me, the bad game-design and level-design decisions just outweigh whatever charming sides Slasher's Keep might have.

Not sure how much content the game can give, since I haven't beat it yet, but I imagine there's plenty since it's a roguelite.

Not so quick synopsis: If you like roguelites and haven't played dark souls, this game is still probably for you. It starts off throwing you into a dungeon while you learn to parry attacks and hit enemies slowly, but as you get used to the game the killstreak system turns it into a more fast-paced fighting loop. You will find yourself often taking hits because you want to get an extra hit in so you can keep your killstreak going. But, you can still play as slowly as you want if you prefer that playstyle, or you have some items you don't want to lose. 

There's quite an interesting thing that puts this game aside from most other roguelites: your character doesn't die. Unless you choose to play permadeath, you only lose stats, levels in skills, gold, and items on death. From this point you can work your way back upwards from floor 1, but you'll be stronger every time you respawn. This makes it easier to get back to where you were last time you died, as well as a form of permanent progression. There are also levels in skills that you can permanently upgrade every now and then. 

I'm not yet sure how 'beating' the game will affect the permanent progression, or if there even is an ending in the traditional sense.

Overall rating: 9/10 - This is definitely my favorite game of 2020 so far. 
Recommended players: Anyone who likes roguelites, anyone who likes RPGs, anyone who likes fast-paced fantasy combat.

Update: I beat the game and got to new game +, which looks promising, but you die in 3 hits to the weakest enemy in the game. This is a game where you constantly fight hordes of enemies. I'm having trouble getting even 25% of a level-up. Haven't made it past the first floor. Not sure if I'm a fan.",1606634012,1606790416
76561198056684191,598060,True,0,0,0,1647,781,1016,13,"Reading the reviews for this game made me realize that you shouldn't be allowed to review video games if you suck at them. Please pay no mind to the droves of crybabies who can't handle VERY simple parkour/jump puzzles. The game does NOT become akin to a platformer at any point, there are just a few parkour ""puzzles"" in the second dungeon that are quite literally the easiest I've seen in any game. If you've ever completed a Minecraft adventure map or had to crouch-jump to get somewhere in Garrys Mod, you will have absolutely ZERO trouble with this parkour. That said, I do feel the puzzles are a bit out of place and in their current state are a relatively shallow addition to the gameplay. I for one would be happy to see more difficult or complex jump puzzles if the mechanic is going to remain a staple. 

I LOVE the Rogue-Lite nature of this game. Upon death you're sent back to stage 1 and have to start all over without any of your equipment, but you retain the majority of your levels, skills, and cash. You also have the option to drop items down an Item Chute located somewhere on each level so that when you die or start a new run, these items will be in the crate that spawns in your prison cell. This allows you to really invest in your future runs and make sure that each run is better than the last. This game is NOT designed to be beat on the first try, and that's part of the beauty of it. 

The visuals are not going to be for everyone. As someone who just barely missed the boat on games like Morrowind and Doom, I love the modern take on such a genre. I could never get into any of these older games because they just felt too dated for my feeble, born in '99 brain to handle. This game brings back that feel with slightly prettier graphics, more fluid gameplay, and without the cumbersome narrow FOV. 

There's two storylines. As of now I've only played & completed the Northerner story, and I found it fun albeit a bit simple. Hard to fault when you've got a one man crew. The final boss fight is very clever and I had a good giggle at the reverse-psychological dialogue from Prince Bindrick, but I was actually disappointed to discover that you can defeat him in 15 seconds flat by whacking the pillars out from beneath his balcony. I know that this is the theme of the game considering the earlier spider boss is melted in her own burning placenta, but something in me yearns for a genuinely challenging boss fight.",1606633919,1606773864

The spider fight is just broken and so buggy its almost impossible to melee. The game is otherwise pretty ok its just not there yet. Not quite good for a rogue crawler.

Fix getting stuck all over the spider boss and teleporting over its head and then it teleporting into the ground  for no reason and i might just change this to a thumbs up and 4-5 it. But for now it just need work

Revised review after 17 hrs
 Still don't thing this game is much good. So many clipping issues, enemies clip through walls and floors making the game just annoying. you get stuck on EVERYTHING including knocked over cups on the floor and 1"" high exploded barrel bases. there are many other things to get stuck on for no reason too. like the air sometime i swear it. so many time you swing and miss for no reason and they hit you for even less reasons then none. unless firing blanks and bugged out enemies constantly was part of the RNG plan this game still needs work. 

20hrs in, Game contintues to be trash, jump mechanics are extremely bad and buggy so why not add jump puzzles? um ok this is just stupid at this point why are there so many jump platform rooms when the game barely can handle walking without clipping into nothing? Do the devs not understand this is just bad for the game. FAIL

23hrs in, I uninstalled the game due to jumping puzzles. these puzzles get larger and WORSE as you go deeper into the game. They are SO broken and annoying i had to uninstall the game.

You start off in a jail cell, push your way out to the first chest and get your first weapon and a random assortment of low level gear. As you work your way through the first level, hacking and slashing your way through giant mole rats and zombies, you slowly start collecting better gear, whacking enemies into traps like spikes or chopping at a wooden pillar to crush them with barrels, or whacking them with your inventory sack to knock them off a ledge. When you die, you will end up back in that jail cell and you will slowly level up your character, getting more stats and getting through the levels faster and faster. 

I'm only and hour and a half into it and this rougelike is way better than most of the others I've played. Others that offer up different weapon drops like Gunfire Reborn feel too repetative in their level generation, so while it's addictive, you'll see the same few tunnels over and over again. This one's level generation is very unique and more spread out from what I've seen so far. There's levers to unlock doors on the other side of the map, buttons to lift bars blocking doors.

The progression system is fairly unique and a lot of fun, you have to try and feel out how strong your character is and if your run isn't too powerful you can just put the whole thing down the chute to Level 1 and start over with the best equipment, there is also a bonus for killing enemies quickly so the early stages don't feel like as much of a grind when you do so.

The secrets in this game that take you outside of the map to find keys and hidden areas are really satisfying to find, some people might be annoyed that there is a chance puzzles and secrets must be found for any progression to be made, not just for goodies, but once you solve them once they're all pretty similar until you move to the next biome/world.

So..

The platforming:
- I've seen over a dozen reviews complaining about the movement of this game but if they are talking about the platforming puzzles or falling in insta-kill holes they are probably complaining just because they are mad they died to a hole or just really suck at platforming. The puzzles that require jumping aren't nearly as hard as they describe it and the game does not in any way trick you into falling into them via platforming or puzzles, it's literally their own fault. 
-There's really only one actual problem with the movement in this game. Items that are destructible (barrels and potion crates) can be a nuisance sometimes to just move around or over them. While I'd classify this as janky, this is more of a slight inconvenience.

The Combat:
-Some reviewers talk about getting stuck at floor 5-ish and hitting a wall in their progress. This is intentional, since you're supposed to eventually die in order to progress in this game. If you never die, you don't scale fast enough to keep up with the enemy scaling throughout the levels, so you have to die in order to scale more efficiently when you come back. A bone you could pick out would be that this kinda sucks sometimes, however, that's why there's an item chute to conserve your progress.
- I've seen some complain about hitboxes and I have honestly no clue what they are talking about, either you are close enough to hit them or you move out of range, I haven't seen any disjointed hitboxes or any of the like and all the projectile hitboxes are telegraphed and fair. A valid complaint would be  how punishing this game is. You get hit while trying to scale or preparing to set up a god run and you will likely be almost dead if not entirely oneshot (depends how deep you are). Personally, I see this as more of a risk-reward mechanic where the deeper you go the better the gear and the stronger you are, but eventually you will likely want to drop that gear off to you next run when you start feeling like you're made out of paper.

I saw some other review that claimed the dev wasn't going to update the game more and that it hasn't changed at all since 2018, though if they looked at some previous patches or read the devs last statement, they probably wouldn't have claimed this. The game has gotten a several content updates (with bugfixes) since January. Also I'm not going to guess what they will do, but the dev did say they'd stick around for the game after the official release (you can read this on the official release update announcement). 
Besides, its strange to cry out slow development of a game when its made by a single dev.....

The Big Issues:
-An actual problem are bugs, Ive seen room gens that have the flying enemies that stay up until they replenish their ammo. This is typically not an issue since you can smack them when they come down to restock, however, very rarely will the room generate this ammo orb out of your reach or even out of line of sight. While ive still made it past a couple rooms like this (I've only encountered 2 in my playtime), this can soft lock players if they don't have a wand or props to move around in order to reach higher places. Additionally, you can lock out enemies from rooms that seal the exits after you enter if you maneuver properly, which led me to actually prevent myself from beating the game once since I managed to do this to the final boss.
-I'm surprised i haven't seen anyone talk about the unlocks in this game being underwhelming, i have unlocked most of the characters so far and the only gameplay difference between each character is just their starting permanent perk. The problem I have with this is that I expected a different kind of playthrough with every character, but that isn't really the case since one perk isn't nearly enough to change how someone would play the game. In fact, I'd argue most perks don't really change how you play the game, they just make you stronger, which in of itself is a complaint since you look at other rogue-likes where perks are a much bigger deal. The story bits for every character is pretty neat and that does make me look forward to progressing more floors to hear the story, but I wish there was actual gameplay variety.

I don't blame most reviewers, the game is incredibly punishing if the enemies have out-scaled you. This game isn't anywhere near perfect and most criticisms are entirely valid, though I've had alot of fun with it (and this game has charm). I just wanted to refute the few that weren't.

It's so simple, but executed well. The graphics are very utilitarian and really grow on you. I'm not sure some of the mechanics are communicated to the player well, but I may just be an idiot. It took me a while to utilize the SACK SMASH properly. It's one shot kill if strategic cannot be overlooked! It took me even longer to learn how you're actually supposed to parry since I was just getting lucky sometimes.

I look forward to putting some more hours into this beast. But, as it sits now, I've gotten more than my monies worth! This game has been my ally as I wait for a UPS delivery to sign for my PS5. 

I'm currently on my best run and I got completely stuck in level 9. I'm going to try to get in touch with the developer to let him know how I put myself in this spot so perhaps it can be resolved for future players.",1606507863,1606507863

You'll be fencing, throwing bombs, finding loot and learning new skills - all of which is good fun, at least during the first few levels. But after the first boss, the game becomes brutally tedious. The number of enemies increases and they start hitting like tanks. One flush hit will cost you about 50% of your health and sometimes you'll be cornered by 3 or 4 enemies without having a possibility to parry every attack or escape. This is due to the janky movement PITA physics. You see, your character has a tendency to get stuck on crates which are below your field of view (meaning: you'll run into them, because you can't see them - pretty annoying, when you're trying to evade enemies and 9 times out of 10 you'll die because of it). 
There are some truly AWFUL platforming puzzles too. VERY few games get 1st person platforming right, and ""Slasher's Keep"" definetly isn't one of them. Even moving around is janky and awkward, jumping, however, is hell. 

It's too bad: This game has some cool ideas, but most of them simply aren't implemented that well. It has those environmental kills that made ""Messiah of Might and Magic"" fun but pushing an enemy into spikes is awkward and unintuitive. Ranged combat is underwhelming. There aren't any cool synergies like in other roguelites - instead there's even more grind than usual. Now, of course, you could try to ""git good"".

But every time you die you come back stronger and learn new things like how to properly time your blocks or not staying on top of a camp fire. 
The game encourages you to look for secrets because sometimes the only way to progress is by going through the secret area which at first took me awhile to figure out. I really like art style and the combat system paired with the old school dungeon crawler look but fighting can sometimes get awkward because of the hit box and some of the enemies being out of reach so you have to sit and wait for them to come or you're gonna have to lure them instead which can get tedious in some rooms.

A few tweaks on the  collision (like broken boxes and heads) like a severed head on the ground should not stop you dead on your tracks. Buffing the wands will make this game even more enjoyable imo. My only gripe is the map layout, maybe make the map clearer because it looks like the walls are pathways if that makes sense. With all that being said give this game a shot or at least give it a follow because it feels like with some few updates this is going to be one of those games where you say ""one more run"".

Hardcore dungeon crawler with a simplified Mordhau type combat system that will challenge the core of your existence you will be scarred sh!tless to peak into a next room / corner especially if you progress further where mobs can kill you in 1 or 2 hits.

If you die you will lose all your items and some levels but since you will start at the beginning after death you will be eventually slightly stronger everytime you get to the floor you died in. So you shouldnt be discouraged to buy it. All of us will get there to the end some faster than others though.

Afterwards its a bit of a chore. You lose 25% of everything when you die but you can send equipment back to your next life. The idea is you can move faster thru the earlier levels and rack up and exp killcount multiplier and come out stronger once you reach the point where you died previously. And levels 1-3 this is mostly true. Level 4 is a bossfight, always. Levels 5 and beyond suffer from poor level design where this is far far far more traps to worry about than actual monsters to kill, thus levels 5 and beyond the killing and exp gain slow down dramatically.

Also there are a lot of very strange collision issues where your character will get hung up at random times. Rounding a corner? Get hung up. Random debris on the floor? You're gonna get hung up.

Also not a fan of having skills be tied to gear. Never have been, never will be.

[h1]Aesthetics[/h1]
[list]

[h1]Combat[/h1]
[list]

Some bugs I've encountered
1) Move to the next level, and after loading in I immediately fall over dead with no enemies/traps around (this has happened 3 times so far in 7 hours, ending my run each time) 
2) Enemies suddenly dishing out insane amounts of attacks with no cooldown or windup
3) The game features a directional parry/guard system, with enemies telegraphing attacks. Their ""recoil"" animation when you hit them takes priority over the windup animation, meaning while you're attacking enemies they can be attacking you with no telegraph or swinging visually
4) Being sky-rocketed by physics objects into pit-falls (which instantly kills you (and this bug is extremely common))

There are just some very odd design choices too. Some of the enemies like blood-moths split into parts when killed, but the gibs and pieces are physical and physics enabled, meaning you can get stuck on the severed head of a goblin and it can block a doorway - but the bodies themselves aren't physical, just the giblets, which is just so odd of a choice.

Everything else is just so unique and fantastic, but just marred by the lack of polish; but because this is a rogue-like and most of the bugs end up killing you just as much as the enemies, I just cannot recommend this unless it gets a little more polish; again, this is otherwise a [b]FANTASTIC[/b] game, it just needs to be put back in the oven for a few.",1606430330,1606430388

There are a couple of bugs that I've encountered, such as being stuck zoomed-in while using a wand, but not being able to fire it and in turn, not being able to swap to a sword, and the latest one where NONE of the gear that I put in the item chute (really good gear, btw) actually showed up in my next run, which was frustrating.

It has one of the most satisfying progression systems I've ever experienced, where you permanently learn skills that you find on equipment. You can focus on a select set of skills (or even just 1 skill) to form a build, or just learn everything to become a sort of well rounded monster. It's really satisfying.

Dying is cool too; you don't just start a new run like you normally do in games like this. You respawn back at the start with the same character, with all of the skills you've learned still in tact. You also lose a few levels, but you only lose 75% of the stats you gained from those levels. So every time you die you start from the beginning of the dungeon but you're stronger than you were previously. You can even send equipment down the dungeon for your next run, if you're unsure about succeeding in your current run. There's a permadeath option for those who want the true roguelite experience as well, so if you really want to start from scratch every time you die, you can!

+Cool visual style. Enemies and levels look interesting. The levels come in 3 different visual styles which represent your depth in the keep.

+Lots of randomly generated equipment.

+Randomly generated levels.

+Adaptive difficulty. Make it as hard as you want by pushing through levels or just make yourself OP by throwing all your stuff down the chute and intentionally die (or use the trapdoor on permadeath). You'll lose some levels and stats, but on floor 1 with most of your accumulated stats, levels, permaskills, and equipment you'll be a god.

+Crafting that offers better weaponry than you'll find off of enemies, provided you get lucky enough to find the parts for the weapons. The crafting also lets you visually make the weapon look like any kind of monstrosity you want... which is nice.

+Skills that make a difference, and skills that aren't just +dmg or +defense. The skills in this game can geniunely change the way you go about playing a run.

+Good audio. I can tell what kinds of enemies are around me by the distinct noises they make, and the player character audio is very different depending on the race you're playing as. I have no opinion or knowledge of the music in the game as I use my own background music.

+Good storytelling. Each character has a story that is revealed to you as you progress in the game.
+Enemy design is on point. You have to stay on your toes and adapt to the situation based on what kind of enemy mix you're facing. Some are melee, some are ranged. Some leave acid on the floor, some give buffs to other enemies. Some charge at you, and some are wielding more than one weapon, etc. etc.

+No time constraints. You take as long or as short a time on each floor as you feel like. This might be a negative to some, but I strongly prefer a choice over a forced timer.

+You determine how many floors there are. You have to have a minimum of 10, but it can also go crazy high.

+""Hidden"" rooms that you have to go out of your way to open. This may involve just hitting a switch, lighting braziers in enemy-infested rooms, or finding a code for a codelock. Sometimes this is necessary to progress, but generally it's just a room or set of rooms with a higher than average loot value.

+3 different weapon types: the fast sword, the balanced axe, and the slow mace. Each plays quite differently and each has many skills that benefit it. The difference between swiping enemies faces with a sword in-between parries, and sprinting into enemies with a charged mace is massive.

+Reasonably priced.

+Haven't experienced any crashes mid-run (see cons).

[b] Cons: [/b]

-Crashes after the last boss seem common and it may or may not affect achievements and unlocks. It hasn't for me, despite crashing, but the forum suggests that it has happened to others.

-Bosses are not super interesting, and there are way too few of them.

-The mid-floors (not the first, nor the last variations of the three) are way too trap and platform heavy. I'm not saying this simply because I hate the traps, I just think they should be more spread out. You essentially go from no traps or platforming sections to having them in almost every room, and when you get to the last 'biome' you return to not seeing platforming or traps again. Depending on how you feel about traps and platforming you'll either love or hate the midsection and feel the opposite about the other sections.

-No modding support.

-Value of items at vendors when selling is a bit simple. The strength of the item seems to matter considerably less than what floor you're on. Say that you carry a sword from floor 1 to floor 20 and then pick up a much more powerful sword on that floor. The super powerful sword should be worth way more, right? Nope. They're pretty much worth the same amount.

-The level generation isn't 100% reliable. It can sometimes generate levels that simply cannot be completed. It sucks but given that you're supposed to die often anyway... it's not a dealbreaker.

[b]Pros:[/b]
[*] Innovative Rogue-like, surprisingly polished, very replayable for different builds/stories/dungeon sizes, progression oriented (even in permadeath), neat crafting, awesome permanent skill learning system, and an overall charming indie game.

[b]Cons:[/b]
[*] If you are a min-maxer, you may spend way too much time on a level selling gear, some insta-kill instances can be annoying, and potentially punishing for unskilled casual players.

[b]Would like to see:[/b]
[*] Slasher’s Keep is fun mechanically to play, but enemy types should vary more. Instead of throwing the same flying cockroach at us, it would be tremendously cool to see a slightly deadlier upgrade visually (aka maybe a gray color with spiked carapace, similarly to how the spider got a black widow variant), or instead one could always just add more common enemies into the game to give more artwork diversity/gameplay experience.

[*] Much like like desire for more enemy variance, more skills would be welcome too, like perhaps some new game plus skills or perhaps just like 10 new skills to play with. 

[*] A lack of storage for items, perhaps there could be a storage box at the smithy or elsewhere that would allow you to store items/components for your current run that of course gets wiped when you die. Alternatively, there could be a permalearnable skill for increasing inventory slots. 

[*] More breakable objects, like regular boxes/barrels/tables. Some more room variations could be cool too.

There might be more to what ought to be added, but this game is really a gem that deserves some more attention, if not at least as DLC.
If you are interested in a challenging, yet engaging progression rogue-like, you ought to enjoy this beyond just a new game excitement high 👍",1606387918,1606387918

The combat is intuitive, you really need to pay attention to where you are, where you're going.
Because in 90% of cases, it's your fault if you died.
The crafting system is something i've never seen before. 
You get to design your very own weapon? Take my money
Enemies fly away when you hit them with your sack? Take my money
It's heartbreaking when you die after crafting the ultimate weapon? TAKE ALL MY MONEY

Only thing I would like to point out is that sometimes the range of weapons/ hit box can be way off and I hope they fix it soon :)

While the ideas here are fun, I've spent the last 6 hours of my game time grinding the same 5 floors over and over. Progress simply comes too slow and it's a core gameplay mechanic here. You frustratingly lose most of your progress when you die so each run feels nearly exactly the same. Also, the difficulty spikes are way too drastic. Rather than being slightly more difficult from floor to floor, there are BIG spikes where you suddenly just die.

The combat is very fun and engaging, if not clunky. There are lots of little secretes to find and there is so much loot you wont know what to do with it. The art style is also great once you get used to it.
It however falls flat in some key aspects.
Right off the bat the punishment system is bad, just bad. I understand what they were going for, but having a flat 25% 
loss in skills/lvls/money is not the right way to do it. Just 1-2 bad runs can make you loose so much progress. 
The horrible level scaling only adds to it. There is no way you are going to gear up or level up enough in your first couple of runs to even make it past the first 3-4 floors. You need to progressively get stronger and stronger with each run, saving equipment and weapons in order to get past the harder stages, but that is so counter intuitive to the degradation system, because  each time you die you lose progress.

The reason for the negative review is that it has a mandatory jumping puzzle, with temporary platforms on level 7. I've tried it over and over, but I can't get the timing down. I hate first person platforming, and if I had known that I would have to do it, in order to progress, I would have never have bought this game. This is a gamekilling problem for me. 

I even tried ending a run on purpose, and when I got back to level 7, again, mandatory platforming puzzle. 

There are other issues I have with it, and I'll detail them below:

1. You have no melee attack whatsoever, if you lack a weapon in your hand. Normally not an issue, but I purchased one weapon that had a specific skill on it that disintegrated my weapon after 8 hits. And it was a boss fight, so had no weapon to fight the boss with. Seriously?

2. There are frequently mandatory secret areas in floors. Either you need to use them to get to the exit or the silver key is in the secret. Also, not sure why, but using the copper key is considered a secret in the first area, before the first boss, but isn't a secret in the second area. 

3. Sometimes due to RNG, there is no Chute on levels 2+. 

4. Not sure why you can't put a forge or vendor on the first level. More often than not, I have more items than bag space, waiting for me in the starting chest.

5. Why you can't upgrade the bag space at all. You run out of space constantly. 

6. Why wands have so little charge and why there aren't spellcasting. 

If the developer made these jumping puzzles entirely optional, I would likely give the game a positive review. However, having secret buttons or mandatory access to other parts of the floor, gated by a jumping puzzle, requiring very precise movement, makes the game cruelly hard. Maybe with enough attempts I might make it, but I'm giving up on it now. Up to now was enjoying myself. But I despise mandatory first person platforming, and its the only reason why I haven't bought Doom Eternal, because again, hate the platforming.",1606357890,1606357890

The game is hella fun.  It's a dungeon crawler, 10 levels, but a randomly generating one so that each run is different.  You have the ability to deposit goods (or sell them).  If you deposit them, they will be available for your next run should you fall in the dungeons.  Some skills you gain, you can perma as well so you don't lose them when you die.

Your character has a few stats and an inventory system.  You use and wear what you find in the dungeons, most items having stat requirements to use them.  Crafting and magic are available too if you don't want to hack and slash your way through.  

Fights are fun, being able to block most monster shots if you time and block the weapon as it comes in at you.  Plus you can use the environment too.  You can push monsters into spikes, traps, or off into pits.  In fact, sometimes its the only way to survive a bad situation...

1. Permanent stats crossing over btwn lives making slow progression possible even with a few bad runs in a row
2. You lose levels and stats between runs - so multiple bad runs in a row can really knock your progress back a bit. While it sounds bad at first, it's actually added a new layer to the game and does something that other rogue-likes fail at - it forces each run to matter. In Binding of Isaac or Hades (my most played games in this genre) , when I was having a bad run I'd just sabotage it or quit and start a new one. I'm motivated to actually keep the run going and try to squeeze out a few more levels in EACH run now so I don't get hindered too much. 
3. Swordplay feels good, and the parrying dynamic works real well too. 

Cons:
1. Level design - I've only reached level 3 so far, so there is a chance the level design might change at higher levels but so far the level design has stayed the same for levels 1 to 3
2. Enemy variety - same as above

Really fun and responsive melee combat with daggers, axes, swords, maces and more. 
Ranged combat using wands that cast lightning bolts, machine gun like pellets, a frost wand that shoots like a shotgun and more . 
Want to push your enemy into spikes or into a pit ? Yes, you can do that. Hit them with your loot sack to send them flying if they fall int a pit they are instantly dead. 

Random loot from all enemies which make all your runs different,  also you can bank your items for your next run and  if you die you  start with them.

There's also a great crafting system. Where either enemies drop weapon parts like hilts, blades, handles, axe heads etc or you can buy them at a shop then you can go to a forge and put them together to create weapons with so many effects that its description scrolls of the screen.

Visually appealing indie dungeon crawler. I wish the parry mechanic were a little easier to utilize in battle (especially playing with permadeath on), not to mention a better, easier to read map/mini-map. Of course, these are just personal preferences and neither really impact the game greatly.\

 I also don't get why the game continues to play when paused when it is a single player experience. I have bathroom issues and had to run to the restroom, left the game paused, and came back to find the one bug I couldn't reach to kill did me in.

Personally, its worth the $10US I paid for it, but not something that has me by the balls demanding I keep playing. And this is coming from a dungeon crawler fan who has been looking for a good new entry into the genre.

movement feels delayed, like your character has to gather momentum to really MOVE. The crafting never came up in the little bit I played, not a common component early on at least, but I didn't have the patience to sit through another run after losing stats (Yes you lose stats on death, permanantly, and you retain your level so you have to work harder to get those same stats back.) to enemies that were standing ontop of each other, so stacked into the one doorway I had walked into, that I couldn't move.

It just feels like it's still an EA game, and from the sounds of it the developer dumped the baby out with the bathwater here, just publishing it and bailing out on any sorts of fixes.

I barely got an hour in and I'm begging for a refund. The game crashed when I tried to close it. It's that bad. Clicking ""Quit to windows"" caused the game to crash. How do you even do that?",1606300728,1606300728

Huh the game? Ain't ever had the pleasure to play an early access title like this. It is seriously polished with just issues to understand its not in its final state. I'd that months won't fly lower on a higher axis is the issue, and that some flying enemies just stay in the air not attacking you.

The polished gameplay? Combat is simple and fun, its got a parry and charge attacks, can you seriously over power your self and earn it and just swing around the level trying to get a high kill chain going.

The UI design is overall very well done. Gamepad navigation UI needs refining but making a game ain't easy and so making the decision to purchase an early access game.

I'd if this wasn't early access buy it. I'd say if you are genuinely interested in this game buy it in early access state. If not you'll just end up coming back once it fully releases, if your interest is still. If it is buy it.",1606278863,1606278863

[b] Summary: [/b]  
 
Slasher's Keep....yeah it's sorta taken a bit of my time. I'm the indie guy who tries to cover as much as I can, so I've got a lot of games at 2-3 hours. Slasher's Keep has dug under my skin, decided to live there as much as Hades on the Switch has, and well I find myself still wanting more of it. There's definitely a formula that Slasher's Keep follows that keeps the addiction going: including a variety of interesting skills and items that make different characters and runs interesting, and a core combat system that gets accuracy of melee combat right in so many ways. All the different systems that Slasher's Keep synergize together to be something that I didn't want to put down.

There's so many things to praise. The rougelite elements, specifically the way that you level and keep levels on death (some of them) and in particular sending gear down to your character when he restarts is fascinating: it leads to important decisions on whether to push forward with the gear you have, possibly losing it, or stop right now and throw everything you own down to your new character. Permanent skill learning leads to interesting build types like an blood slurping axe murder or a swordsman who focuses on cutting off heads that turn into explosive bombs. Crafting system is cool with the hilt/gems/swords system, and it all helps that the combat is a good back and forth, rewarding precision. 

The story is probably the thing that lacks here from the character portion, only occurring between levels, although the environmental storytelling isn't that bad honestly (the orcs having pinup posters is a hoot). 

Look, see that play time? Go look at all the other games I play, and all the types I play. I play a lot of different games and genres. Slasher's Keep found itself being my overall gem of 2020. That's saying a lot, and well, it'll serve you well.

[u] Lists: [/u]
[b]Positives:[/b]
[list]
[*] I'm unsure if Slasher's Keep or Crack Cocaine is more addictive. Granted I've only tried the first, but I'm going to go with it.
[*] Combat System is precise: not blocking with your sword in the right way will get you slashed, and it feels natural in the progression of attacking, blocking, and trying to deal with multiple enemies.
[*] Skills are reasonable and yet a good mixture of old staples (lifesteal/crit) and some really interesting ones (decapitating exploding heads)
[*] Rouge lite system is actually a great balance and leads to risk/reward mechanics that can undo a few runs with a bad decision, but rewards smart decision making.
[*] Enemies AI is good and yet can lead to some hilarity, but will challenge you. Good leveling and progression.
[*] Weapons have a real weight to them, all of them feel different and require different play styles. 
[*] Have I said addictive? It's addictive.
[*] Sound design is great in general, and music while repetitive is also pretty great.
[*] Good enemy variety for the most part, even with repeat enemies that have a twist. 
[/list]

[b]Negatives:[/b]
[list]
[*] Could have done a little more with the storytelling elements.
[*] Once in a while you get a level configuration that ends up you needing to find a secret in order to get to the next level. 
[*] That right now I want to play it more despite the fact that I have other games to cover right now.

I would say its possibly worth the money depending on your taste in games.  but unless the developer smooths over some of the edges i don't recommend it, yet.  I would expect on average for people to sink in around 5-10 hours of gameplay before all the little physics and hitbox annoyances make you lose interest. based on the gameplay i have experienced (up to floor 5 out of 10) i would give it a 70/100.  The concept is great, visually unique, it has depth and variety but it also feels  a bit janky and the gameplay gets repetitive. Basically its a good game that doesn't quite have the flawless feeling, endless fun factor that top tier roguelikes (isaac, risk of rain, ftl, rogue legacy, spelunky, slay the spire) have.  If this game gets regular updates and or the dev makes changes based on community feedback i think it has quite the potential to be killer.

Pros: 

   - Art style - very unique, original feel

   - depth/variety - so far, a decent amount of enemies, weapons/armor, trinkets and map variety.  Tons of unique skills you can inherit on your character allowing for different play styles

   - weapon customization - fun feature where you can collect different weapon parts and create your own weapon with unique stats and skills based on the parts you use.  you can also ""build"" the weapon, moving around and rotating the parts you use to make the weapon look as badass or as funny looking as you want

   - Combat - combat feels pretty smooth, is easy to pick up and has a good amount of variety to it

   - character leveling/skill progression - as you level up you add points to attributes, to increase your stats, and you gain skill points to permanently inherit skills from unique weapons or armor and upgrade the skills once permanent.  

Death/respawn - when you die you keep most of the character levels, attributes and gold (i would say you lose around 20% of both upon death), not enough for it to not feel like you are losing everything and just starting all over (see cons for the negative side to this).  the game also has a chute feature where you can send any inventory item (consumable, weapon, armor,  trinket) back to the start for you to use from the start when you die, allowing you to semi-breeze through the first few floors.


Cons: 

 - janky movement/ enviornment -  controls are fine, but movement over and around objects feels off and you get stuck on things that you should be able to walk over (exploded barrel parts).  Along with this, there are destructible and movable objects, potion crates and explosive barrels can be broken/destroyed and yet regular crates and barrels are indestructible, only able to be pushed around, get in your way and falling in front of doorways (stupid shelves).  it feels like everything movable should also be destructible, otherwise rooms and areas just feel (and are) too cluttered.  

 - Wands seem way under powered - not much to explain here but i have almost never used my wands, except to see what they do.  and when i do use them it usually ends with me taking more damage than i would have, had i just kept my melee weapon out.  It may have to do with the limited capacity to shots, but also just the damage seems so weak in comparison to a melee weapon.

   - Item stacking on ground - When you say open a crate or kill an enemy that drops multiple items, everything stacks on top of each other, often glitching inside of the open chest/ dead body and it is nearly impossible to hover over/ move around and see the items on the ground, meaning you have to either pick it all up and drop what you don't want, or if your inventory is full, drops items out of your inventory, pick up items from the ground, look at the stats, keep/ drop items you want, then pick up the items you dropped (i don't mind having to do inventory management, its more just the fact that i have to do it just to see the items).  

   - Hitboxes - it may be due to the 2d/3d fusion paper mario-like art style but the hitboxes of objects and enemies feel off.  sometimes for example it takes me like 6 swings to finally make contact with, and break open a pot if my character is not literally humping the pot.  when it comes to enemies, depending on the angle you are trying to hit them at, you can pretty easily whiff an attack that looks like a spot on hit (usually due to stairs, items, other enemies or camera movement)

   - minimap - I feel like the map is too small, making it hard to see where the key points are and where i want to go.  i feel like the minimap should be more zoomed in and have a large map you can open up to.  Also just something about the style of the minimap makes it hard to see where exactly the doors are in relation to the walls/rooms (hard to explain, might just be me)

- Parkour map post floor 4 - There are around 40  perfectly timed jumps in a row and you have about 2 seconds in between jumps to make the next jump.  In concept this is not that hard, and it is passable once you try enough, but due to the physics and lack of a jump that give you really any vertical, you often get slowed by a wall or have your jump input eaten, causing you to fall all the way back to the start.  For me, this section really is just a nuisance and frustrates me when i get there.  Although i will say at least for the first 10 floors i believe this only shows up twice, which is not as bad as i had initially thought.  (from other reviews it seemed like every level after that would just be riddled with these types of puzzles) 

   - Repetitive - (Edited) The difficulty scaling at first is very high, and requires a lot of trial and error and frustrating losses, but as you progress and become more confident with each floor, there is less and less resetting needed to get further.

   - Losing progress -  when you die you lose everything (item-wise) you did not stash away in the chute.  Because of this you need to farm and stash away second set of items in case you die.  this seems fine, except for when you are trying to strengthen you character by resetting runs aka stashing all your best items and restarting to get more gold and consumables/ weapon parts in order to be strong enough to progress.  If you accidentally die while doing this, you lose every item you have and almost all of that progress is lost, all of the gold you spent on top of the line equipment is gone,  and depending on how much you were grinding, you lose ALOT of time/progress.  I accidentally fell off the edge while looking at the minimap, speeding through the beginning few floors after resetting about 8 times in order to prepare myself and get good armor and weapons for the big boss and it felt like i lost hours worth of item progression.

I do have a few things that I think could be better or could be changed
1. Make intelligence and dexterity more useful (not just being used to equip equipment) They could do this by having dexterity make you run faster and intelligence making your wands more powerful.
2. I think the game needs more enemies to spice things up. 
3. More outposts like shops and smithies.
4. Make the skills more potent and actually change the way you play instead of just being a flat update. This would need a rework, but I think they could do it by say only allowing you to bringing 3 skills and then that can be upgraded by using three skill points on having more skills able to be used instead of upgrading skills.

First off this game is closer in feel to something like Void Bastards than a traditional rogue-like or dungeon crawler. There's a bit of humor to be found, but don't expect to be hit over the head by it unless it happens to be that orc holding a cleaver. It's a slow, and very simple game, with the majority of the action to be found in directional parries and sack tapping enemies into pits and trap like something from Dark Messiah: Might and Magic. There's plenty of loot to be found and a crafting system to be had, although I haven't had a chance to dabble in it myself. There's perks that you can learn from equipment like Path of Exile, with the ability to assign points and make them a permanent part of your build, along with RPG stat point standards.

Bottom line you like the spirit and pace of old dungeon crawlers with the look and feel of something more modern like Void Bastards then pick it up, its worth the low price.

The game starts off well enough. The graphics and music are pretty decent, and charming, in a retro sort of way. 

The combat, while nothing special, works pretty well. The melee, in particular. The AI is pretty dumb, but that might be a good thing, as we'll discuss in a second.

The game starts off easy enough. You find consumables that refresh health. You have ways of using the environment against the many enemies you'll encounter, which makes up - to some degree - for the fact that your weapons are fairly underpowered compared to the amount of damage the enemy deals.

Around level 4 or so, however, the game gets very hectic. Enemies start doing [i]ridiculous[/i] amounts of damage, and equipment become obsolete very quickly. I honestly don't know how people survive. Seems to involve a lot more luck that skill, most of the time. Good thing the enemies are dumb as heII, because I can't imagine how we'd get through them otherwise.

The reason why I'm requesting a refund, however, is the jump puzzles. Around level 4, you start encountering them, and they just suck the fun out of the experience for me. Have me figure out how to use the environment against a mob, by all means. But having to perform 20+ perfect jumps, in sequence, to get to the top of a tower, and get a key, when the character seems to handle like he's drunk, is not worth my time.

https://youtu.be/z2_rxNnbjpM [/h1]

Slasher’s Keep is a roguelite that plays unlike any other roguelite I have ever played and it has an extremely unique art style and overall feel.

The most obvious thing to mention with this game is it's presentation and artstyle. The game takes place in a 3D world but all the enemies and the loot you find in the game are 2D. 

So they do that you thing that you may have seen in other games do where the 2D sprites rotate to always match your perspective. And this gives the game a kind of unsettling vibe, at least to me because it makes it seem like every single enemy in the game is always watching you.

And so you start in a dungeon and you open a chest at the beginning of every run that will give you like 2-3 random items normally like some armor or accessories and a weapon.

You will be finding a lot of different loot so there is a lot of attention on the inventory system. You have a bag that can hold a certain amount of items by size and every item you find takes up a different amount of space and you can equip any items you have on your character. 

And one thing I really like about this system beyond it just being very streamlined and easy to understand is that if you mouse over an item like a helmet when you already have a helmet it will show you very easily if it is better or worse in various different stats so you don't have to get out a calculator to figure things out.

From there you than go from room to room killing enemies, finding new loot, leveling up, and trying to find the exit point to climb one stage higher in the dungeon to escape.

And the combat in the game is a little more rigid than you might encounter in other FPS roguelites but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing and I’ll explain.

So for every weapon you can swing it normally, you can charge attack in three different ways by holding different directions, and you can parry enemy attacks. So as enemies see you they will start coming to you to fight you and because the models are pretty much these 2D sprites they have to get really to close to you. 

So a lot of times you start getting overwhelmed by several enemies just getting right up in your face. And a lot of the enemies take a lot of hits in order to die. So in order to not get completely overwhelmed. You can actually hit enemies with your inventory sack knocking them back a little. 

And so the combat is a little more about timing your attacks and blocking the enemies and overall just very spacing focus. You can’t let the enemies start overwhelming you right up in your face because otherwise it gets extremely hard to hurt them without taking damage.

Also the game knows it’s not this crazy action packed game and so the rooms you fight sometimes contain traps like spikes that you can hit enemies into instantly killing them or pit you can knock them into.

You also have wands which are the other major way you can deal damage. There are special ones but the one you will see the most is something that shoots these slow projectiles at enemies. And they all have a limited amount of ammo and will break when they run out. So you can’t use these too much because ammo is so limited and that is one of my minor complaints with the game of what I have played so far.

The other huge part about this game is it has a leveling up system very similar to an RPG. So when you get enough experience to level up you instantly get all your health back, you get a couple skill points, and sometimes new abilities. 

The game is definitely on the challenging side. I have played for a couple of hours in order to get a general feel of the game to make a review but I know for a fact that there is so much in this game I haven’t even scratched the surface of. So it’s definitely the type of game that you could play for countless hours to master and discover everything it has to offer.

So overall I would definitely recommend Slasher’s Keep to fans of FPS roguelites as long as you know it is a little less action packed in terms of high octane combat and more fleshed out in RPG elements like the inventory and character development side of things. Also if anything you should definitely get the game just to experience the really interesting style of the 2Dish sprites in the 3D world as it is really awesome.",1605985726,1605985726

As there are still some issues with it, some of them minor, some of them major.

Minor being issues with the controller, it's impossible to quick swap away from a broken wand with the B button. Avoid able with the right skills or setting the hot swap bar, but still irritating.
Lack of any tutorial or explanation for setting up the Y button or Hotbar, again not rocket science but irksome.
The speech volume is way too low and leaves the few speaking characters, mumbling gibberish to themselves.

The major one (that I have encountered) is with level generation.
It's still possible for the code to generate a map with no way of getting through, beyond killing yourself and losing everything.
This, is super frustrating when it happens on dungeon level 1 and thus you have literally lost all the gear you've been hoarding from higher levels.

But, it's still a good game and definitely worth your time, with luck these issues will be ironed out fairly quickly.",1605984651,1605984651

So a couple of points. 

First off, the aesthetic. If you've ever played Daggerfall Unity you know exactly what to expect (if you haven't, check it out, it's a blast). The characters are emphatically not 3D and everything looks hand painted. It makes for a charming, low key, and slightly goofy experience, especially once the blood (of which there are buckets) starts to splatter. The weapons range from silly to badass to ridiculous. Want a club made from bananas tied to a stick? A prehistoric stone ax? A classical xiphos? They're all there. Armors are the same: everything from fur to fop. There are even great decorations: come for the endless dungeon crawling, stay for the slightly disturbing orc pinups. 

Moving on to UI. It's a tad frustrating, to be honest. The keymapping, for example, is not intuitive and fixed. Want to draw your weapon by clicking the mouse? Too bad, press x. Your inventory is likewise fixed and cannot be upgraded, although this is part of another rather clever mechanic I'll get to later. Fortunately, everything is simple and easy to learn, so slightly frustrating is as far as it ever goes, 

Mechanics. This one is tough. Part of me things they're pure genius, the other wants to strangle the devious dev who made the decisions. There is no pause, but there is a save spot on every floor. The floors are small, but random and packed with baddies. Stores exist, but good luck finding one when you need it. You lose everything when you die unless you've deliberately sacrificed something to an item chute for your next run (truly, if you love something you must learn to set it free). The crafting system is clever, but in five hours I've found TWO smithies. And my personal least favorite, you lose levels and skill every time you die. Which you will. A lot. This makes the grind feel endless, but you learn, and you get better, and the game rewards you with learned perks that can't be lost. 

This doesn't mean it's all frustration and no payoff. Remember that size-locked inventory? That's because it's actually a bag you carry in your offhand and can beat monsters with for knockback, preferably into one of the VERY generously distributed spike traps. Oh, and spiking any monster is one-shot. Satisfying. There are no shields, but you can parry, and I don't mean just pressing a button: you have to actually block the swing. It makes combat more entertaining and less mindless. Ranged combat is by means of disposable wands that act like everything from pistols to shotguns and mortars. 

To make a long review short, Slasher's Keep is a dungeon-crawling roguelite created by someone who obviously loves the genre. It takes a simple format and uses its mechanics to force the player to make choices that can frustrate, but also create an atmosphere and experience that both enhances replayability and extends enjoyment. And the cherry on top is that it's all wrapped in an aesthetic and art style that says ""it's okay to just goof around, kill stuff, and laugh at the posters on the walls. Go ahead, bash the slightly befuddled looking wizard into the spike pole: that's what it's there for. Besides, he deserved it.""",1605982780,1605982780

The dungeon lacks any kind of atmosphere. I think its supposed to be going for wacky, but beyond like two or three funny things the majority of the environment lacks any kind of character, not helped by the strange, mannequin bodies and sad attempts at animations.
Melee combat is so stiff and unintuitive that I'm willing to believe that your meant to slowly switch over to ranged weapons as you progress through the game, but I wouldn't know.
There are two interesting ideas; to block you hold down M2 and hold your guarding weapon in the direction that an enemy is attacking from. Now with this in mind the weird animations could be forgiven to a point. The problem is that you can't block every character's attacks and if you cant block their attacks your just going to take damage because you move so slow and awkwardly. Also hitting the flying enemies with melee weapons is infuriating. The second okay idea is that you can smack people with your loot sack, which is genuinely funny and unique, mechanics wise it knocks enemies back and you can knock enemies into spikes or off the map. The problem with this is that it doesn't knock them back far enough nor does it recharge fast enough. This is probably how your meant to avoid unblockable attacks but the timing is off.
There's a lot they could have done here. Add a dash mechanic. Hire an actual animator. Work on world design. Fix the doors so they don't always swing open in the most inconvenient direction, and tons more but honestly it may not be worth it. Its a cheap game and was probably one of the dev's first projects and I'm sure it was some good experience for them. But I just cant recommend this, in fact I can't even believe how anyone could recommend the game. Its not just bad its unfinished.",1605952842,1606015503

Game is split into 10 levels, with death meaning you fall back to level 1. You also lose the vast majority of items (Unless you dropped a few down the garbage shoot for the next run) and your levels/stats deteriorate. Lots of fun weapons to find and loot, or craft if you're lucky enough to have found a forge and the components in a single run !  

Pros 
- Combat way above indie game level. I wish more games learn from this game.
- Lots of loooooooooooooooot
- Mix of cute cartoon like environment and cute sprites with face meltingly punishing perma-death

Cons 
- Severed heads from enemies tripped me over and I died.

Edit: There are some serious flaws in this game making it so I can't recommend it until its fixed.

Sometimes flying enemies will be in unreachable spots, stranding you in a locked room until the game opens the doors for you after several minutes as fail safe. Extremely frustrating and ruins the pace

The platforming. Why would you put platforming in a first person game? It comes out of seemingly nowhere and also ruins the pace of the game. 

The map is god-awful and confusing. Running around the level trying to find the exit or the secret door that leads to the exit is not fun.

Sometimes levels are unbeatable, forcing you to restart your whole run. 

Finally, there needs to be more enemy and boss diversity. There's basically only five enemies you'll face and two bosses.

This game has the potential to be one of the top rougelites, but so many glaring issues show up after a few hours of playing. I probably won't be playing this game until some serious work is done on it.",1605900556,1606775428

Most of the time, you run around killing stuff and looting their corpses - you're essentially SACKing the areas you go through. The combat feels quite hack n SACKshy, and pulling off a parry is always SACKisfying.

The death penalty could use a rework - it's cool that you lose items upon death, and that you can send some back for future runs, but it kinda SACKs that you also lose 25% of your stats - if you then die before regaining those, you still lose 25% of stats you have now. This can lead to a downward spiral if you mess up too much or you don't play your cards right. I'd much rather you kept levels, but each level took exponentially longer to acquire, so that you're essentially softlocked before you can reach the later areas of the game. The crafting SACKstem is also pretty good - later on you can essentially SACK buff on top of buff on your weapons, making them op until later stages of the game. Some of the skills feel somewhat underwhelming.

The artwork is phenomenal - the game has a cartoon-like aesthetic, with hand drawn sprites for pretty much everything. Enemies and items have all of their angles manually drawn, which looks kinda goofy, but it fits in and brings a lot of charm to the table. Not to mention the SACKsy goblin pin-up posters littered around the first area, those really are a SACKht to behold.

The game is really hard though, so don't say you haven't been warned. However, the fact that I SACK down and played this for 5 hours in a row without realising should tell you all that you need to know.

However, it does suffer from a lot of bullshit since a good run can be ended through no fault of your own. Currently there's a gitch where you can clip into an object, be thrown into the air, and then fucking die because you landed into a pit. You could also just die outright to the enemies after you fight the spider boss because of the massive spike in difficulty. It's hard to get a feel for what hurts you and what doesn't since the enemies look the same but scale up, this is common in games but in most games you'll see your enemies using a new type of weapon, or look at least a bit different. (maybe make the zombies have glowing red eyes when they start hitting like fucking trucks. That or a helmet. Anything to make them stand out from the zombies from younger levels.) 

The game tries to be kind to you by allowing you to send items back to yourself through drop-boxes that can be found throughout each dungeon, this means you can go through the start of the game again with better lot and a chance to retry. The problem is more to do with death feeling unfair at times, and character unlocks being rare events as well (I've played for awhile wanting to unlock the slimeman or demon but still couldn't find the rng based spawns for either event. Kinda ass.) I don't mind RNG in games when it's done well, but I've played for 14 hours already, and not encountered a single character unlock. I shouldn't have to play up to 50 hours or 100 hours to find these things. If the percent chance is this low, I feel like I won't ever find it. So once again, my failed runs feel like they got me no where.

This game is absolutely great. I'd just recently tried to get back into mount and blade, but the mod I tried was crashing.
I was really looking for a good fantasy RPG mount and blade kind of game. Boy oh boy did this scratch that itch and even more that I didnt know I needed.

A big part of this game is movement, weight and knock back power. You can knock enemies into traps, off ledges or just make space to charge up another heavy attack. You level up and get various passive skills from challenges and... maybe just some early levels. These didnt feel like they did too much early.

Then I started to find activatable skills, things like Riposte. I started trying to get as much Riposte skill and as heavy of a sword as I could. I kept dying to the spider boss that gates off the second zone. Eventually I realized a little trick that does tons of damage to him (which I'll leave out so you can discover it)

Zone two is absolutely mind blowing. The first area became a 'try to find as much loot as possible while blowing through the levels kind of deal. But zone two makes me feel like indiana jones. So many traps, everywhere. You'd think they wouldnt be that hard to deal with but you're wrong. You WILL be in a position where you get your last tick of health shaved off by a trap you cant avoid while not getting hit in combat. 

I found a really cool hammer that lowers your attack speed but shoots an unblockable wave of fire after you swing. I found another skill that lets you charge up a stab longer to dash forward and deal alot of fire damage, and there's another I've found that lets you overcharge forward heavy attacks to deal even more damage.

The farther I get in this game the cooler it becomes.

downsides 

Some hitboxes feel way too wierd to the enemies and your weapons swings thrue them.

Games parkour part plays quite horribly as sometiems you get stuck in the moving plaforms and the maneuverability doesnt really help at all

some rooms feel way too crowded for their size so its easy to get stuck.
My instance was when i entered a new room, there was 3 melee enemies and 1 healing enemy. i pretty much had to use every consumable i had to get free for even a second.

It is a game with a lot of depth in the few mechanics, and systems it has.

The developer has been supportive enough, and he has even added an alternate level of difficulty for people who choose to play the game at a more relaxed, and care free, pace.

The big issue that I have with the game is the balance of difficulty, at around the fourth floor of the game or so, the game has a sudden difficulty spike that changes not only the enemies that you face but also the traps that you come across.

There isn't a gradual process through which this happens, and up till that point you'll probably lack the defensive items neccessary in order to progress further.

It is a problem to have a rogue lite game that understands the concept of a game that progressively becomes more and more difficult, but it is a completely different thing to have a game that forgets that part of making the game more difficult is to make the player stronger, in order to give him, or her, a fair chance in fighting against his, or her, foes.

So i'm torn in between recommending this, or simply not recommending it.

On one hand this is an incredible job for one guy, but on the other it is a game that requires a heck of a lot of development of its systems, and, or, mechanics, in correlation with its absurd, and sudden, difficulty increase.

Playing on ""Easy mode"" didn't make a single difference.

So you're pretty much reduced to replay the game again, over, and over, up until you get to the fourth floor, or any of the subsequent ones.

Memorize enemy patterns, develop strategies, and force yourself to change your style of play in order to bend to the game's will and requirement of not getting hit by almost any trap, or enemy around you.

It's a similar case of what happens in Enter the Gungeon with how the game becomes increasingly difficult but forgets that the whole concept behind a rogue-lite game, beyond procedurally generated levels, and random item drops, is the fact that while the game becomes more difficult, the player also becomes much more stronger.

The Binding of Isaac gets this, Nuclear Throne understands this to a lesser degree in favor of offering a much more challenging experience.

Slasher's Keep, and Enter the Gungeon do not.

This are rogue-lite games that require you to play them endlessly in order to then comprehend each of the different adversities thrown at you, so then you can overcome them.

I frankly don't have the time, or the patience to do such a thing.

Generally the game's enjoyment, and my so called ""immersion"" where grinded to a halt around this sudden difficulty ""spike"".

I would recommend the game to support the developer.

Between Enter the Gungeon, and Slasher's Keep, the difference is that Enter the Gungeon was created by a team of several different individuals, while this game was created by a single one.

Giving him the benefit of the doubth, and considering a neccessary experimentation in connection with the development that video games require, I can only hope for this to get fixed, or resolved in some way.

Otherwise I'll have to remain ambivalent, and upset that a game as creative, and clearly, as with much passion behind it, remains a game that excludes people like me from playing to simply appease other people that prefer a much more challenging, some might say, relentlessly, ""gated"" experience.

Maybe through altering ""Easy mode"" even further and not scaling the damage that the enemies do to player this can be resolved.

Either way, in its current state, I'll would go mixed, but knowing the general attitude that the developer has had toward his game, and the fact that he listens to feedback.

I just don't have the heart to not give it a recommendation.

You can pick from a variety of characters that unlock in certain ways. Each one has a different story.
You must keep getting to new levels to find out more of your character's story.

When you choose a character, you must also choose what to do when you die. You can enable permadeath, or just keep it at softcore, where you loose 25% of your levels and the skills obtained from them.
This means that when playing without permadeath, you will start back at the beginning, but with most of your experience and skills, and therefore you have an advantage. And even you, the player, will gain your own personal experience, and know how to better survive the dungeon.

The dungeons are randomly generated. So are the items, with their damage, armor, bonuses, and included skills. This is what drove me into Slasher's Keep.
The items even look different based on their rarity, so it's even more satisfying to find rare items.

Also, you can make your own weapons, if you have the parts, and are on every other level, alternating with the shop.
Even the parts are randomly generated, but categorised into hilt + blade / shaft + head types.

I'll explain the one minor issue I have. If, like me, you only pay attention to the main stats of an item (damage and armor), you'll notice you'd choose a mace, because of the high damage.
What I want is for all weapons to have the same range of damage so that I can use all the weapon types more often.

For a single developer, it’s an extremely impressive project. The difficulty may feel cheap, but the attention and care gone into design is clear. On top of this, Slasher’s Keep does have character. Nothing about it feels cynical, It’s just going to require a very specific type of player to get the most out of. If you’re looking for a fun, casual dungeon crawl, or even one that offers a clear route of progression for getting more heavily involved over time, Slasher’s Keep is currently not that game. 

Overall, A quirky first-person dungeon crawl with some interesting interplay between systems and a wide variety of loot, let down by baffling and frustrating difficulty spikes. Getting parts of my pretend body torn off in fantasy settings is fun. Genuinely wanting to mutilate myself is not.

A truly impressive effort for a one man team.  15 dollars well spent to enjoy what's already here and to encourage more.

Personally, I would love to see further elaboration on the exploration gameplay.  Whenever there's a permanent minimap, I can't resist the urge to have it on all the time, which results in less satisfying exploration, as I find myself with one eye on the map constantly.  I realize some people would prefer it that way, but I would love for it to be more deliberate, say, having to equip the map or make it take up the full screen.  Or even having to find the map and compas a la Zelda or Hollow Knight.

The objective is climbing up through the floors of a dungeon, killing monsters, gathering items, discovering secrets and even crafting your own weapons, to fight against a Boss located at the top floor. The crafting aspect of the game took me entirely by surprise, the moment I found a forge and discovered that I could make my own creations with the resources I gathered (and even name them!) made me so happy, I just love having my own weapon designs and actually see and use them in-game.

The combat feels pretty good, as you progress, you'll find other ways to fight the enemies you'll encounter where you don't even have to worry about parrying their attacks, but I have found myself clashing swords and parrying attacks for a while with some of them and it feels pretty awesome.

There is elemental damage like fire and ice, and all kinds of perks that give you some advantages like regenerating mana on your own, making the severed head of a monster explode, etcetera. You can get them either leveling up, via armour or via weapons. Here the weapon crafting plays a huge role, as you can gather the resources you need to create something with the perks you want.

The sound design is very good, everything sounds as you would imagine and it fits perfectly with the environment, from the grumbling of your character, to eating some critters straight from the ground. The voice acting, for what it is (and I mean, there aren't many NPCs or else with real dialogue on it), is wonderful. Especially the shopkeeper. I'm in love with that character, he's without any doubts my favourite.

As I said, there are some minor issues that I have experienced at the time of writing this review, like some doors not showing up on the map, when dying and loading for some reason the map resets (you have to discover what you already discovered before, and fill up the blank map again), on higher levels, the monsters tend to deal lots of damage even if you are well-prepared for them, but once you learn to move around, parry precisely and use your environment (such as spikes, traps or bottomless pits) to kill your enemies, you can pretty much be untouchable. But as I said, the developer is actively working on the game, so there's nothing to worry about!


To sum up, Slasher's Keep it's a magnificent game that will provide many hours of entertainment by exploring all the dungeons' sizes (small, medium... even infinite!), completing quests/achievements, creating all kinds of weapons (the weirder, the better), unlocking new characters (that have different initial perks), using all kinds of wands to see what they do, managing your inventory and knowing what to send through the hatch for your future self, and discovering all the secrets that lie within the dungeon's floors. And also by wasting all my money at the shop to hear those sweet sweet voice lines. I strongly recommend grabbing this game!

1) The monsters are strengthened too much for each level. The problem is that no matter the rarity of your equipments, they will become meaningless when brought to the next level and you need to loot new weapons ""fit"" for the level. Or in other words, you will feel kinda ""naked"" when you enters a new level.
2) Still the difficulty. Below is how I deal with monsters in the game: i. try to grab attention of any single monster in a room ii. block-attack-block-attack..., repeat until it dies iii. repeat until all the monsters dies. It's so repetitive and totally a different game from the video. An unsuccessful block will cost you 20/120 health (or a health portion) on level 3, which is too costly to try anything cool. Wand is also not so useful since on level 3 it will basically cost ALL your mana to kill a single monster if you don't have a powerful wand.
3) The skill system is too RNG based. I once got three ""ice mage"" traits on leveling up while I dont have weapons dealing ice damage.
4) Death penalty. In non perma-death mode, you will be punished 25% attribute points on death, which makes you weaker each time. In my view, the current death punishment is actually not a big difference from perma-death cause I don't think I can achieve as much with less attribute points. I'd rather restart a new game.
To be fair, I may be biased cause I didn't spend much time or I may be poor on this game. I will give more tries and will edit or delete the comment if inappropriate. Experience sharing on the game is also welcomed.

So far i made it to floor 4 and i shouldve make it a lot further with the way i play, but i lost focus for a moment and didn't use some of my 24 potions which i gathered trough the run.

I saw someone mentioning the gap of difficulty between floor 1 and then 2, and while this may be true, there are tons of ways to kill monsters. I found out the best way to do so is by running back a little and strike, run back a little and strike and so fort. There is the possibility to ofcourse do it in the way Damian Schloter wanted it to be, which is by precise blocking, but that took em longer and well....this feels fine as well. Traps can be used, together with the smart use of wands for luring monsters out of a room instead of jumping right in there and locking yourself. 

One annoying flaw on my end was the fact that you can get overrun by monsters and have nowhere to run lol, hence insta death is on the horizon after that.

The game is in early access, and it shows. The great potential of the game is very clear already, however. In it's current state I can recommend it IF you can deal with the stuff I am going to mention now;

The game is difficult and buggy. This should be noted by all who would consider buying it. It's playable, its fun and its interesting. There's an ending and boss fight. It has everything a game would need to have. However, some bugs will lead to your death, save stations only save for when you quit the game, dying always sends you back to the first level with a huge penalty to your level (and thus your skills). On the other hand, some exploits allow you to farm items infinitely, grant you the posibility to get ludicrous stats and to craft a weapon even Zeus himself would be jealous of. 

Those exploits are what allowed me to beat the game. My character has over 500 in each of the 3 stats, my armor and weapons were blue or higher, with my weapon having 24 attachments with purple and blue parts too. I was one hitting every enemy with my ice wand, sniping everything from doorways. I could have gone into melee, but not only did my mana regen to 100% thanks to having a lvl 24 ""coldblooded"" skill, so i could spam wand shots forever. I also still got one hit by enemies. 

No I'm not kidding. At the 4 or 5th  level of the dungeon, enemies started one-hitting me, and they never stopped. No amount of armor would save me. Only through save-scumming (alt-f4 the game then reload a save if you die) did I get to the end. If I play a roguelike I expect to be screwed by bad stats or shitty items, but I also expect that epic loot will make the game easier. In Slasher's keep, you don't need good loot. You need cheesy loot. You need those 10 items with ""Coldblooded"" and that epic wand so you can snipe everything before it hits you. You need seperate items with ""Artisan"" and ""Mastersmith"" to be able to make an OP weapon that gives you 5 skills per attachment and allows you to attach 25 of those. 

I had all of that. And then the game decided it would generate a floor with geometry blocking off the only route to the exit. I tried everything to get past the inside of a boulder generated in a doorway. To no avail. I simply ran into a spike 3 times and got back to the first floor of the dungeon. I was level 20, not anymore though. I used to have epic gear, not anymore. I picked up my shitty weapon and armor and went on my way. The first enemy I found did 3000 damage to me. I had around 500HP. I reset again, losing even more levels. Now my guy is level 5. I got a couple floors in again, because I found a wand and have literally over 500 intelligence. Everything still one-hits me. But then again, I also kill everything in 2/3 hits and never have to get close. 

If after reading all this you still think giving the game a try is worth it, be my guest. I enjoyed the 14 odd hours I played of this game. I will probably play more, but I also eagerly await the much needed balance patch. 

PS.

Mr. Schloter, should you be reading this, your game is great. But by god is it not optimized correctly. 
- Enemy damage needs to scale better (as in not so high so quickly), or armor needs to do more, or both. 
- Some bugs need fixing, like the one randomly disabiling your block or attack. Or the one where you start running really fast for no reason, or the one where the room generation makes a secret door in a rock, so you cant run through said door, or the one where skills that are present on your weapon and armor don't actually show up on my character.
- Many skills need hard caps so you can't have ""Bloodlust"" so high it literally ticks your multi-kill time counter up instead of down every second.
- Sacrificing a (blue) potion to the altar should not give a (green) item with a chance to get a free potion. Because that (green) item then has a chance to give a potion when sacrificed, leading to infinite items and potions. The purple Stat-up potions should not be able to be sacrificed, as they can come from sacrificing green or higher potions randomly, but they give blue items when sacrificed, leading to free blue items very early and very easily. 
- Dying should have less of a penalty, maybe resetting you to a save point, but at the very least not taking (so many) levels from you as it does.

2. There will always be a time where you're stuck in a corner and your potate sac just doesn't do it, Doesn't feel deserved to die like this and feel simply... bad.

3. This point is a bit more personalized but i would love to see more new weapons in the game like Polearms and Bows, both of these can really freshen up the game and add more ways to play.

4. The option to disable posters around the dungeons. I was streaming this game the moment i got it and i had to look away instantly to avoid seeing some tiddums on stream and to hopefully not face a ban.

The random generation of dungeons and loot makes it interesting with every new start,  as you never know what you will come accross (this appears to be the case with the passive skills you are assigned after levels up's and through gear).

The combat actually feels responsive..its great when you one shot a zombie or goblin and the blocking appears to be on point.

You have quite a few breakables which help including the vases and the boxes with the health potion symbol on, these tend to drop money, food and potions to help replenish health / mana or to become invulnerable for several seconds.

I have only got to level 2 (almost to level 3) and noticed how much harder and how much more HP the mobs have, so make sure you get a few level ups on the first level before you go on ahead further lol.

You also have alternative rooms for example a shrine you can offer gear to for a reward or curse, you also have shops, health/mana globes and a mounted lion head which offer you quests i.e. kill 2 creates with an explosion x2 (look for barrels with fire symbol on - require one hit to set off, just make sure your not trapped in one corner before you do :P)

To note, when you enter the fairly big rooms the door tends to slam shut behind you until you have killed every creature in the room, so be aware!.

I have also come accross 'components' some very powerful which basically add to your weapon as an enhancment, I have yet to apply one however, if your lucky enough I think there are forges's that allow you to apply them to your weapon that can appear on levels - on this ..you sometimes get map drops which will show you important symbols on the map, i.e. secret doors, keys etc.

I have only come accross one bug that appears to be after I have used a wand, i am unable to melee or block until i remove the weapon and add it back on through the inventory, sometimes the mobs will walk into boxes and shelves which impede their movement but you can use this to your advantage, smacking the mobs off into the abyss or onto a spike trap is satisfying.

I am looking forward to spending more time in the game, obviously it still needs work i.e. more enemy variety, more loot, boss fights, more rooms, classes etc but this is a thumbs up for me!..I am looking forward to seeing what more this gem has to offer.",1518230063,1518230063

If you're into dungeon crawlers, this should feel familiar.  Level up, collect items, become powerful, kill everything.  Sound is great and the art style I particularly enjoy.  The game takes a dull and drab environment and transforms it into eye candy while still keeping the gameplay we enjoy so much.  Did not encounter any bugs.  Even early in development, I can recommend.

[h1]Full Review[/h1]
Slasher's Keep is a fun dungeon crawler with cartoony graphics and a light-hearted atmosphere.  You start out ""locked"" in a prison cell, with your only option to fight your way out.  The prison cell room is the same every play through, but each subsequent game features a new dungeon layout (procedurally generated).    The goal of the game is to escape the dungeon by crawling up throughout each level of the keep.

Weapons are varied in the game; clubs, maces, magic wands, swords, etc.  Dead enemies can drop various pieces of gear, either weapons, armor, potions, or money.  If you've played a dungeon crawler before, than you get the idea.

Controls are decent, and I only have minor complaints.  Attacks feel okay, but I wish they carried some more impact.  You can block as well, but only if your main attack animation is completed.  One thing I thought was particularly clever is the ability to use your inventory bag to hit enemies with.  

Sound is excellent, from the ambient noises to the soundtrack to enemy grunt noises.  The music at the title screen is particularly good.

Graphics are a bit of a highlight for me.  I really enjoy the direction they took with this.  Instead of gray and dull as most dungeon crawlers are, this game finds a away to make things still look great.  The game is a little silly, and you see that from the artwork on posters in game and from various things throughout.

Even as early as it is in this games development, this feels like a full game.  I recommend.

The game is hack n' slash and it's very unique from what I've seen so far. The art style is something you don't see often, and minor details here and there are nice to pick up on. Maybe I just suck at the game, but it's actually somewhat challenging, which keeps you motivated to play to beat the floors. You actually have to use some survival strategies to avoid dying, rather than chug potions all day in other rpg like games. There are glitches here and there, but the game overall is very impressive in my opinion.",1518207608,1518207608

I have been monitoring this game for a few months as I nervously waited for it's steam release. I was overjoyed today when I saw it had released this morning. After starting  it up and quickly choosing a randomized character, I found myself locked in a cell with the keys being visible through a crack in the wall. After attempting to retrieve the keys for a minute, I accidentally stumbled upon the solution to the puzzle. While I wouldn't spoil it here, it was unexpecteed and hilarious and really sets the tone for the rest of the game. As I emerged from my cell, a nearby chest rewarded me with a bunch of bananas on a stick/mace and a wizard hat. Slasher's Keep is a lighthearted, hand drawn dungeon crawler with peppy, skyrimy hack and slash combat and fun physics. It is clear that Damian Schloter loves his game and put a lot of heart into this project.

Update:

After putting 10 hours into this game I would stay it still holds up. There are some minor issues, the biggest being difficulty scaling in general, but the one big technical glitch was fixed by a patch on the first day. There are no issues that ruin the game right now in my opinion. I am sure this game will get much better as Damian continues to update and balance it. Even as it is now, If you like the idea and are willing to deal with minor early access issues as the game grows and improves, you will likely enjoy this game. I wholeheartedly reccomend it.",1518189469,1518385986

The only down side i have for this game is I imagine you need a larger play space due to no locomotion in game yet. All of the assests seem to be preloaded in your play space. So if you do try this out make sure you have a larger play space. This game might also have the same features though much like Job simulator where the enviorment is sized properly based on your play space.

It is clearly not geared towards advanced realism but it still manages to offer a realistic feel so that it doesn't just feels like an abstract painter or a puzzle app — especially if your goal (like mine) is to create a somewhat realistic and logical airport, which does take planning and focus.

I like many of the features, designs, and mechanisms of this one. So let me just make a table below with common items and let's see who wins!:

UI: SA < ACEO - ACEO wins in the UI category here by quiet a bit. It's just way more polished and organized which makes for better, less frustrating gameplay.

GFX: SA > ACEO - SA's style really comes through on many items and areas. From characters to floors to gates. It's a cut above ACEO

Realism: SA < ACEO - If SA would only implement better scaling of objects, longer runways, etc than they could take this category in the bag. Right now the runways are so short that it makes the entire game feel cheap and like a children's game

Finance Management: SA < ACEO - ACEO's money management and contract system are an easy win here

Flight Planner: SA ? ACEO - This is SOOO close to being a tie. I still haven't decided... sorry, one tie point for the flight planner.

I'll continue writing this when I'm not about to pass out. For now my suggestion is ACEO but it's well work grabbing both as they each have their strengths.",1614064651,1614096016

It's fun to build an airport from the scratch and think at least 2-3 steps ahead. Think about ticketing, security, gates, baggage claims is a must. But then, what you should do on the airport while waiting for the plane? Where to sit, eat, drink? Where is the toilet? Once you will find answers on these questions, Pax satisfaction will go up. But that's not the end. Build the gates (S, L, XL), baggage and refuel systems. Then check if you have enough runways to not delays the flight. Build the relationship with the airlines to offer more flights as well.

Is the main game boring? Try to play any scenario from Workshop to hit the goals. Subscribe for more mods and make your airport nicer.

Does have this game any cons? Yes, sometimes the Pax finding path is not working properly. It causes overload of the closest security check while others are almost empty, if you have more security areas. Other than that, all is good.

The game is fun, I can recommend. It took me just 4 playthroughs - 44 hours (include the tutorial) to get 100% achievements, with no rush for it. By playing it since zero to medium airport (6 small, 3 large and 3 extra large gates) the achievements were received naturally.",1612363173,1612548881

For those who want to achieve a 'perfect' airport, where everything flows smoothly, these bugs will make you want to give up and quit. Honestly, it’s quite ironic and laughable that there is a bonus for 'Perfect Ops' (no delays or passengers missing flights in a whole day) in this game because once you reach an airport of a certain size, I've had so many times where a Perfect Ops streak has been ruined because of one or more bugs which cause unnecessary delays. When I look around online in search of solutions for these bugs the solutions are usually ‘reload your save’ or ‘send it to the devs and get it repaired’ which I don’t think are necessarily appropriate for a game which is considered released and no longer in early access. No, I haven't installed any mods, played the 'Edge' version, or edited my save file, so this is a pure vanilla save/game.

The bugs include (sorted in order of frequency I encountered):
[list]
[*] Baggage cars randomly refusing to load baggage while baggage unloads fine (the fix apparently is to ‘reload the save’). The rest of your baggage cars are sitting in your hangars idle. There is no indication of this happening other than to pull up the flight schedule and see that your planes are fully loaded but not departing.
[*] Chefs who are supposed to be working in kitchens going on long joy walks across the whole airport (and no, not to bring food to café/kiosks). Once they even ended up in the underground level (-1) where I sort the baggage, which was protected/inaccessible (so how did they get there?). I had to build a stairway so that they could get out, or else they just get stuck in there forever. Again, there is no indication of this happening other than seeing your cafes/kiosks suddenly having no stock.
[*] Baggage cars unloading your baggage to the conveyor system, but it never shows up in the conveyor and never shows up at baggage claim. So, all your pax end up waiting around baggage claim for hours until they give up and leave (never found out how to fix this one, other than demolishing and rebuilding your conveyors) Again, there is no indication of this happening other than seeing all your pax waiting at baggage claim with no baggage in sight. 
[*] Sometimes one or two pax just don’t show up for the flight at all.  I find it often happens when you save and reload the game again, or are actively building stuff. If you don’t do anything and just let it run, it usually doesn’t happen. There is the ‘highlight passengers’ feature and I can’t find them anywhere. This is during a low-traffic time where transport capacity is not an issue. Usually happens when I reload saves. 
[*] Having walkable remote gates is a nice feature, but pax will walk across the whole airport, including across taxiways and all. Also janitors will commonly walk across the taxiways and grounds of the airport. Not sure what for.
[/list]

Minor bugs/annoyances:
[list]
[*] Pax who are on a moving walkway will get booted off the moving walkway and reduced to a crawl every time you reload your game. If your airport relies on long sets of moving walkways to move pax around, pax may miss their flight because of this. This leads to the absurd situation where I question when to save my game just to make sure pax don’t miss their flight when I resume playing after.
[*] Pax will sometimes wait/wander very far from their gate, even if there are no items which can satisfy their needs there. 
[*] Pax will sometimes take very circuitous routes to exit the terminal or get to their gate. I notice this more in arrivals so its not as big of a deal, but sometimes pax have missed flight because they took an objectively longer detour from security than they had to. 
[*] Pax are addicted to drink machines. They always queue up like mad for those, and often times if you have multiple drink machines side by side they will queue up and wait in line for the same one. This is also the case for other items such as vending machines / phone charging stations / ATMs.
[*] If your fuel storage runs out, then planes waiting to refuel will sit there. There is no indication to alert you to buy fuel. The only way you find out by noticing that your pax have fully boarded but it does not leave the gate, or by constantly checking the fuel capacity screen.
[*] Multi-lane roads are a nice feature but sometimes cars (especially garbage trucks) will change lanes for no reason, just to go back into their original lane.  No they are not overtaking another vehicle. 
[*] Baggage car will take baggage from conveyor and load it to the plane soon after the plane arrives. It will only do this once. If checked luggage arrives at the port afterwards (i.e. too late), it will never get sent onto the plane. Apparently, this is only cosmetic and doesn’t affect satisfaction/scores, so I’ll just chalk up this one to the devs thinking it’s all right for pax to leave without their checked baggage.
[*] Sometimes you build a ticketing desk and the staff agent will never show up at it after any length of time (they show up at the other ticketing desks I built at the same time). The only fix I found is to dismantle and rebuild it.

If you wish to build a small airport and have fun or a monstrosity that processes 10.000 people per day, you can. The fundamentals of a good sim are there. Economics management, needs and, most importantly, the quest for expansion and more profit.

The bad: The game is lacking a decent tutorial. While there are tutorials there, they fail to mention how to generate a profit. That, you have to find out for yourself through multiple failures. However, when you figure out how (selling stuff and advertising), the game becomes a lot more fun.

The ugly: The price seems a bit too high for a Prison Architect clone (graphics, government grants, road system etc) and there is no music. If you can see past these issues, you should definitely get this.

The verdict: If you enjoyed prison architect and you're here for some more, grab this title. I'd recommend waiting for a sale so that the price reflects the value of the game.

Placing a building sometimes leaves the brush on the map until you pick another building and discard, planes can fly backwards and sideways, as well as cars... Cool idea, cool game mechanics, etc, but bugs are killing all the fun. And I am not even trying to push the game to its limits. All my builds so far were really simple - 1 terminal, a couple of gates, under around 50 employees in total,  Building a nice airport takes time. I was playing, building, selling, for a few iterations and then my workmen just decided not to build anything anymore... Not cool... Some AI got broken and the player cannot progress. Pax also get stuck sometimes on escalators. All your flights can get cancelled because some piece of baggage got stuck somewhere(plane can depart leaving all baggage and some people behind, but it can depart if it is missing just 1 bag!?!? Really?!?!). I am dedicating some time to build something nice and complete the achievements and then some random glitch pops out to ruin all the work I have been doing.

Or did they decide to fire all the devs after the first internal release? I would really like them to complete the game or at least honestly say it is early access or something. One of the in-game windows moved slightly outside of the boundary, so it was not closable... Luckily there is an option in the gameplay menu to reset all the game windows to their default positions...

Took awhile for me to get used to the game mechanics but I was instantly hooked after playing through the tutorial! There are some bugs with placing planning tiles and blank text prompts but once I restart the game it works just fine, I think running the game for more than 6+ hours can do some weird things to it.

Definitely giving this game a solid 9/10, apart from the bugs and the fact that there could be more decor added, it is super fun and addicting, I would highly recommend for other fellow aviation enthusiasts!

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/598330/discussions/0/3003298578161894684]Link[/url]

It wasn’t that I thought the game was bad but rather just not fun. It’s obvious that this game is a labor of love and a lot of effort went into making it. It’s also obvious that I was in the minority since over 80% of players enjoyed it. Something didn’t seem right to me so I listened to the developer's response to my thread and changed my perspective.

First of all, I stopped forcing myself to play the game. I believe that I was doing this because I had bought the game full price, which is something that I rarely do, so the desire to “get my money’s worth” was really pushing me to put in the hours. Once I stopped forcing myself I discovered that I was thinking about the game all the time. Not just the game in general, though it really bothered me that I didn’t find it fun so I pondered that a lot, but also thinking about my airport. How could I improve it? What was my next step? How big could I get it? Suddenly the game was drawing me in instead of me drawing it in.

Secondly, I stopped looking at it as a tycoon simulation game and instead started looking at it like a pure sandbox builder. Yes, there are tycoon simulation aspects and quite honestly they are all done really well. However, I was relying on those aspects of the game to create fun for me and they didn’t. At least until I started looking at them differently. Instead of putting the tycoon simulation first I put the building first. This had a profound affect on my overall enjoyment of actually playing the game.

I could go on and on about this transformation of thought but just let me wrap up with who I think this game would appeal to. If you’re looking for a complex tycoon simulation where it’s all about the simulation then there might be enough here to satisfy your needs. There wasn’t for me so I changed into those type of players that I think the game would appeal to the most…Hobbyists!

Those would be the type of people that could build a model railroad town (like the Peyton Manning commercials) where the town itself is the main focus. Not in a video game but rather in their spare bedroom, basement or garage. The railroad station, little tiny pink houses and most certainly the trains themselves are the hot topic and that which one gets excited about. The tycoon simulation aspects are a bonus and therefore become even better than if they were the focus.

So if you like the idea of building a model airport and running it the best that you can through on the job training then this is your game. Get it and support the great developers that have poured their heart and souls into this game. I hear that they are coming back to it soon enough to improve it even more based on player feedback so there’s that as a huge bonus to owning it.

I put in 17 hours since my “not fun” thread and I can honestly say that I’ve enjoyed every single one of them. Chances are, I enjoyed plenty of the 41 hours before that but I just didn’t know it. It can be hard seeing the forest for the trees. I guess that I just got lost for a bit but now that I’ve seen the light my path is pretty clear. This game is in fact fun for me and I’ll continue to play it well into the future.

As a side note: The game has great tutorials (don’t be afraid to go back through them whenever needed as a refresher) and the Government Grants work pretty good for Milestones as long as you work them strategically. I’ll let you figure that out on your own but my hint is to not take any until you know that you can complete them rather quickly. Lastly, I’m mixed on the graphics. Some assets look great while others not so much. Nothing looks horrible but some could be better. The sprites on the other hand…All I can say is set them in options to be the original sprites and play at least 2 steps zoomed out.

Lastly, the Taxiways, Runways and especially the Airplane models look Amazing!",1604683665,1604685202

SimAirport = Very easy to get into compared to it's competitor. Tutorial consists of a handful of missions chosen from the main menu. Everything has a slightly isometric cartoon look to it and it fits the ""Prison Architect"" gameplay style well. Things just work.

So I love how I was able to make this huge airport of a sweatshop, yet, I had one ticketing counter, 5 XL gates, and many other things. So you got to experience California traffic. Not to mention, I found a way to glitch some of the passengers onto the runway and t a r m a c so they got ran over endlessly by planes.

I deny...a...uhhh....accusing apple farmers of voting for aragantang pool filters! Uh......I quote this from the declaration of independence...you know...you know.. the thing! :)

Epic game. You can just create a hell hole of a airport and literally capture and never let out passengers and release them onto the runway and continue normal operations, or you can have a prestine nice and airport.

76561198065508767,598330,False,0,0,0,2041,2041,463,46,"This game is a decent airport simulator and is worth putting quite a few hours in if you’re into planes and/or airports. The aircraft models are accurate, the sim AI is ok (could still be better), and the graphics are acceptable - think Prison Architect but an airport instead, with no storyline and less mechanics. Recent updates have been quite good, with new, (somewhat?) fun features added and old, meaningless features removed (e.g. the passenger needs satisfaction used to only be in %, which was very confusing; the exact overall % calculation still isn’t clear, but at least in the needs satisfaction screen raw numbers of pax happy or not are shown, which makes it easier to understand), although I think the optimization and performance became slightly worse. The scrolling has improved in recent updates, although the zoom is still on the slow side for me, even at maximum speed.

I do wish the government grants screen didn’t pop up whenever the game is loaded, although it’s a minor issue. It would also be great if roads could be dragged horizontally, as opposed to needing to be laid out piece by piece. However, these minor (obvious) design flaws are outweighed by the bugs in the game, which the top negative review from July 15, 2020 sums up quite well. Although I don’t think the bugs are crippling in general, they do make the game’s strongest feature of simple and soothing flow considerably less simple and soothing at later stages. I recognize that design flaws and bad features are being improved at a reasonable pace and the effort put in by the devs here, but there are quite a few game and performance bugs, and some of them have been around for years. A lot of the fixes occur piecemeal, so I doubt that all major bugs will be removed soon. There’s also not a lot to enjoy later on in the game, when performance gets worse and you run out of goals, as improving your airport brings more pax and more bugs and less efficiency. All in all, it’s a decent sandbox game, but there are better options out there, and I wouldn’t get it at full price.

Ultimately, I think that is what warrants a 'negative' review under Steam's binary rating system - the game isn't bad at all, but there are alternatives that do everything better; since the game has no story at all, SimAirport has nothing extra going for it and thus should not be your top choice unless (for example) Airport CEO is not your cup of tea.",1601449805,1601450094

This game is played in a 2D top-down format which is not graphic intensive at all. But when you try to expand your airport it will cause the game to lag uncontrollably due to the amount of passengers on the screen. My computer runs on an Intel i9 and RTX 2070, which is just sad to see the game perform like this. After numerous attempts to further expand my airport, I just couldn’t bear the consistent lags and freezes anymore and uninstalled the game.

AI pathfinding is another big issue as cars and people would seemingly get stuck in place where there are no obstacles, and there is no way to force them off the map. This would eventually cause more entities to be stuck on the map and further contributing to the lag.

I tend to avoid early release games.  I'm not really interested in submitting tickets for bug reports.  I do enough of that at work.  I play video games to forget all of that, so I just wanted to preface my review by saying that.

I had a great amount of enjoyment for a while, and this game actually seemed like one of the rare ones where it might actually be possible to unlock all of the achievements.  Unfortunately, I quickly found that two of the achievements, regarding passengers per day, would be unreachable due to lag that is introduced into large airports.

The developers of this game appear to be quite responsive to bug reports.  I did take a quick look around to see if there were any fixes.  I tried a couple of things, like reducing my workers and janitors.  In the end, the game just becomes unplayable when I reach about 7,000 passengers per day.

Needs some more features/options.

Unfortunately, as of July 2020 SimAirport is still riddled with crippling bugs that make it downright impossible to achieve the smooth flow of operations that the game's challenge/reward system encourages you to strive for. Vehicles and passengers get stuck constantly, construction workers stop halfway through a job, and airplanes get delayed sitting for hours waiting for passengers that never spawned on the map. As you rack up penalties for delayed and missed flights, you'll try to understand what's wrong with your terminal layout only to realize that 3 passengers on that last flight have been stuck leaving the security line for the last two hours for no apparent reason.

I just didn't like this game. The concept seems fun on the surface, create an airport and service passengers. But there is a whole lot of work for not much payoff. You can make a little zone for a cafe, make a little zone for an arcade. Then just watch lots of people move around and get on airplanes. You don't really feel like you are making progress. There is not a good work/reward structure and its made worse by a bothersome UI. Items are buried deep in a nonsensical UI and you end up having to type the name of the item you want every time you want to build something. 

The game is not without potential, but I don't know if they are still updating it or not. Better sorting in the UI, smoother and more powerful/efficient click and right click menus along with auto finding items which belong in similar zones would improve the game to a playable point. The game also has weird graphic bugs which while not game crashing are extremely annoying and ruin the game play. Just zoning a cafe caused a massive Cafe text to appear over top half my terminal and the zones didn't automatically appear and change color to show the new area. 

I think another problem is the game seems to be trying to be a simulator rather than a management game. There are layers of complication that doesn't need to be there or would be better suited in menus rather than in the game. The whole conference room, office addons just make bothersome clutter. You also have to build a electrical room which only gives you a PA speaker. Its so strange to have to build this huge room, in a game where there never seems to be enough space and yet you don't think about, plumbing lighting or AC. I think that really sums up the game. Making you build a room for a ""PA amplifier"" and build an office and hire an overpaid nobody just so you can build a couple speakers which make announcements while ignoring Lights, Heating, Air, Plumbing, The thought patterns of the game are very... off.

Well, here it is more about the airport management rather than the airline management, but I find both of these games to have a similar and engaging gameplay.

This game is excellent. The developers are clearly very much involved with the community and while they listen for feedback, they're very positive in order to fix or improve certain areas of the game. I saw this happening even recently. 

Let me just say that I do look at Steam reviews before getting something new. I saw a lot of negative remarks in terms of sounds, I guess that must have been from older versions of the game because honestly at the moment, the in-game sounds is really good! Well, in my opinion at least. :) 

The game offers a lot of micromanagement, but you'll learn it quickly thanks to the tutorials provided and by experimenting on your own. The game UI is really easy to understand. Kudos for that search tool that allows to search for objects to build or to search for tools. It is really handy! 

There's a huge variety of aircraft and a couple of fictional airlines to play with, but you can also get mods and even have real airlines! The graphics are really eye-candy even for a 2D game.

If I had to point out anything less positive, those are just things which I strongly believe that devs will eventually fix or add at a later stage of the game. In my opinion, the positive aspects outweigh any negatives. One thing that does bother me a bit is how the aircraft move around the airport, especially the departure from gates - looking on the bright side, it is kinda funny to see at work, especially the tokyo drift departures. Again, I think this is something that will eventually get fixed in the future. 

For a game like this, I would also love if we had the possibility to play in multiplayer with other airports. 

I'm having a lot of fun with this game, I love how I have got figure out the best way to make my airport the most efficient as possible.

I give it 10 / 10, highly recommend on getting it.

... now back to airline management. Would be nice if you devs would consider on doing such a thing!",1593720852,1593720852

[h1]Recommendation[/h1]
I liked SimAirport. I felt that some aspects of it were too slow or that they didn't lead the player well, but it definitely had lots pf cool aspects of a real airport that I enjoyed. I liked building on multiple floors and I felt that the AI to get things built worked well with me. Although I did struggle with the item organization to find the things I wanted to build and the grants lead me to build things that weren't particularly beneficial. I recommend SimAirport for players that are interested in building their own airports, that are comfortable laying out their own plans without guidance, and are willing to put in a significant amount of time to build up currency and infrastructure.",1593418121,1593418121

Tried to change the display quality to fantastic. Selected fantastic from the pull down menu, then waited about three minutes to see a message asking for confirmation of the changes. Clicked to apply the changes. Waited a long time, and then saw that despite the confirmation, the graphics had reverted to fastest (lowest quality, I guess). Tried a further 4 times to change the graphics quality, each time taking as long as the first. Gave up and just accepted I would have to play on the lowest quality setting. Started the tutorial. It looks completely awful. Crude does not express it. I guess this is because it is bad in the first place, and I can only see the lowest quality of already bad. The graphics would make a game from the 90s look good, but perhaps they might be tolerable if I could actually get higher quality settings. 

Stopped here so I could ask for a refund. This game is not ready to be released. It crashed and even changing the settings created instability and crashes and the changes did not function.

- No music, literally just silence 
- No character animations 
- Graphics are choppy, have sharp edges and look like it was grabbed from google images and photoshopped 
- Graphical glitches on the screen, just makes it feel like its incomplete   
- Queue line creator doesn't even function
- All the people movements look terrible, its just a static image floating from x to y
- Doesnt support higher resolutions, or higher quality vector graphics, its very much static images, even some of the alerts and icons have white edges.... now that is real cheap

I love these style games, I dont mind low level 2d graphics, like Prison Architect, but this is really cheap, its very very subpar graphics, these guys are not graphic devs whatsoever... use some of the money and hire someone to revamp this.

While the devs are making updates, I appreciate their work, but it has a long way to go to feel like a ""finished product"" right now, this feels unfinished and should be labeled in ""beta phase"" it is not work $26, it is work $12 if that.

Definitely recommend if you love micromanaging and building an airport.  Anyone who liked games like Prison Architect will adore this one.  Support seems to be timely, I got replies to some issues I was having within 24 hours on Discussions.   There's a Discord group as well.

About my only gripe is the lack of polish and some mild glitchiness and unspoken limitations (why do airplane gates snap to some unseen grid!!!!  Makes planning very difficult.)  Could use some general QOL improvements (eyedropper tool for floors for example!)

Pathing shouldn't be an issue, especially when you can't do complicated loops with taxiways, placement of objects, and the like.  When an object can't be placed or used in that place, it shows red...
so why is it that randomly, people will forget how to get their shit off the security scanner? or go up a flight of fucking stairs? Or that their flight is leaving from the gate THEY ARE SITTING AT but WON""T GET ON.
I don't know if the dev's are just high when they made the game, but next update, please, no more content, no more nonsense, fix the bugs! Pathing bugs that suddenly screw over: 'perfect running bonus', the people's appreciation of the airport, and airport trust all get screwed over when pathing issues arise.
how does it screw the perfect running bonus? simply, the plane doesn't reach the gate on time, or departs on time, and is just PERMINANTLY STUCK ON THE TAXIWAY (untill you reload the game, and it remembers how to MOVE THE PLANE)
how does it screw over peoples appreciation? When people get suddenly stuck or lose their shit on a security scanner, they get upset.  When they are upset, your rating goes down. And they don't move or find their shit for at least a day, or longer.  Or until you again, save and reload the game.
same thing with airlines trust.  Plane stuck, can't reach gate, and is just stuck there on the taxiway.  No plane can get by, so they have to move around it, they can't use that taxiway, and hell, the runway they are cocked in front of is now useless also.
for the love of gods... FIX THESE BUGS.
They break an otherwise relaxing game.",1589697182,1591735526

I found it to be the perfect amount of micromanagement, enough to keep me busy and give a realistic feel, not so much that it distracts from the overarching goal of operating a successful airport. Getting started is a challenge and the tutorials are definitely recommended. 

Once you've got acquainted with all of the various features, it's a super addictive sandbox mode. I generally don't enjoy sandbox sims since I want there to be an objective to achieve, however I've had a lot of fun creating airports from scratch and seeing how many passengers I can process daily. Seeing 25,000 little sims flooding through your carefully designed airport with mesmerizing efficiency is also extremely satisfying.

Make sure that you download the mods for real life airlines to add an extra layer of authenticity.

Second, Planes that never leave wreaking havoc in following flights. This is apparently only true for ""remote gates"".

To me though it still feels its missing ALOT of things,

Pros: 
- Detailed management of an Airport. 
- Its not too fast or too long to learn the game mechanics, just right to keep the interest up
- Freedom of choise on how to build... pretty much anything
- Tired of the airport...? No problem Sell it and Start form a scratch with the money you get from the sale!

Cons: 
- Still glitchy
- Must rework the Airline Negotiations system (You have to arrange 8 flights BEFORE you can arrange the contract details and pricing with an airline company)
- There are missing alot of airport operational items (For example There is no option build a car parking or there is nothing else related to the arrivals area besides the baggage system. Once the passenger picks the bag he heads out to the bus. Car rentals is a good example of what missing at that area too)
- a very simple commercial pricing system (only runway usage and charge per pax)where if you currently MAX OUT the prices you get rich fast without any real effect on the downsides. Airlines might be unhappy but you do not lose any flight deals. You keep earning money making the game very easy to play. its almost an unlimited money cheat that one

After figuring out the above i will wait for a big update before i give it again some good playing time. the lack serious competition on the Airport management games makes this a good game to play if you like the theme

I decided to jump into a game because I felt confident in the controls. However, when I tried to run my own, I got lost on the controls.  You can't click on an object to select it and see basic info. You can't assign queues to check in desks, resulting in people completing ignoring the queues and standing in a blob near the kiosk, yet also they also have trouble leaving the check in desk. The planes don't arrive until the next day, which means you wait a whole day (and also pay for services) waiting for something to happen. Even on 12x speed, the fastest game speed, it just took way too long. Also, as someone who lived through construction for several months at my apartment complex, the jackhammer noise is so annoying.

It also has a lot of mods and custom airlines in the workshop to make the expirience even greater, you can download real airlines and their fleet and build a good airport for them. I like that you can negotiate to give airlines some of your facilities and ask the airline to give you flights in return. Going from a small airport to a massive airport takes some time and you'll face a lot of challenges in that process. In the beginning you'll probably mess up a few times but if you learn from your mistakes that you've made you will eventually understand all the techniques to build a good and efficient airport that can make you millions.

I have almost 60 hours in it and I have not even touched on multi-levels, large gates and planes, multiple terminals and runways, etc.  There is a lot here.  

Pros:

Smooth interfaces.
Search tool for finding objects when you want to build.
Total control over all aspects of the airport operation including buying and selling fuel.
Just enough fine detail to keep you occupied but not too much so that you cannot seem to let it run.

Cons:

You cannot move and object once you place it.  You have to dismantle it and buy it again and then place it.
Some objects (like the gates) snap into the grid when building, but you can't seem to ""nudge"" them one or two spaces.
The passengers (PAX) sometimes seem to just run all over.  they can run through zones rather than around them.  I don't think it hurts your score, but it looks rather odd.

The game is also quite lagy considering it's minimalist graphics. 

All in all, it's fun when starting out, but very difficult to progress due to glitches and programming. I thinks it's a great start for a game, but needs a lot of reworking and finishing touches.

Was very excited once I got my first large gate up and running and saw the big-boy planes rolling in (and the mobs now roadblocked at my ticketing and security gates.  Aaaaah! )   Rather than huge, grand 'projects' I'm finding a lot of joy in making small changes, little tweaks.  Redesigning by necessity and by watching PAX interactions with the environment.  Then watching how it effects everything - thereby suggesting my next little project.

All it takes is for one unhappy lunatic to set your place on fire, so make sure you're prepared.

If you feel like upping your game, you get to build corporate conference halls and offices with marble flooring and indoor fountains, ripping off airline execs with overpriced gadgets, food and drink as they wait to get bullied into throwing more airbuses at your gates. Sure they'll want their own, 'exclusive' lounges, stores and so forth, but unless you give them an absolute armpit of a location, you can make them bleed money for it.

However the big problem the game has is the AI so lets take a look at whats wrong with it. 

First off, the AI gets stuck constantly for no reason whats so ever which causes the passenger to miss the flight and then you miss your bonus. It seems to get worse the bigger the airport you have. Now for most games it tackles these edge cases of stuckage with a sort of timer to reset the AI, nudge them, give them a new path, something that forces them to get past the issue. However none of that is in the case here. Typically a save reload will fix this but that shouldn't be the only option for a game out this long. Plus by the time you notice it, its too late at night and their flight as left as there's no good indication system that a flight is waiting on 1 passenger. My main game save has a stuck bus at the moment and the reload save workaround doesn't help so now I just going to have a bus stuck in middle of my airport forever.

The biggest problem with the AI, it isn't...normal. The boarding, the interactions, and just overall decision making feels off. Some vague like examples: Your plane has 249 out of 250 passengers on board for over an hour and you think, where's the last passenger? Is he perhaps stuck? Nope, he's across the airport standing in line at the donut shop. wut. Luggage is just left in the system for outgoing flights because its too slow to begin with so the AI just abandons it. Planes and passengers will take weird paths to their destination that make literally no sense at all.

Edit: April 2020. AI still sucks terribly, bus is still stuck inside my airport, and this needs to be fixed sooner than later.

Edit: June 2020. Bus is still stuck inside my airport.

BUGS
--Runways don't get repaired, and get stuck in repair mode, even if I always allow maintenance (no window) and set it to repair anytime. My workers just don't both, or leave without finishing the job and never go back. Even with runways set to Urgent.
--Rogue bags pile up. When I reload the game, they all disappear, but the longer I play they pile on. It's like a visual memory leak.
--People walk in circles before finally getting to their destination. Weird pathing.

CRITIQUE
--There's no mid-game. I find myself wanting to just get a small amount of income coming in, which is then a mindless stream of income unless the game glitches and I go bankrupt from no available runways, and then I want to just let the simulation run until I have enough cash to buy all the land and foundation out to my final square-footage. Some sort of incentive to build small, then expand to medium, then expand to big would be great. As of right now, I skip medium.
--A Move tool would be wonderful for objects. Basically, move this desk (or whatever) from A to B, which queues a Deconstruct order, and then take that same item to the new location B and install.

I hope the dev keeps adding content. I'll keep coming back to this game whenever I feel like building an airport. I would recommend to any willing to enjoy an in-dev game still needing some polishing, but plenty stable enough to play and enjoy.",1579917935,1579917935

Now that that's out of the way, this game is very well put together for early access. As the devs said themselves, the foundation is strong, now they can build on it. They also look keen to continually working on the game until it's completely polished before full release. Small things are also added to increase immersion, like ATC callouts for incoming and outgoing planes.

Would I recommend the game? If you're a fan of Cities:Skylines, the old SimCity games, and others of similar genre, even a bit more on the micro-managing side, yes, this game will steal hours of your time through long play sessions to get things just right. Also helps if you've got a bit of an air-travel and logistics bug in you,

Now is it bug-free? I would not say so. During long play sessions I've had pax AI just decide to stop working correctly, and this would take a save and reload to resolve. Also had a bug before it was fixed where a pax was seemingly lifeless on the tram tracks; a bit spooky.

Workshop integration is now at a very high API integration level, and I feel with the right mod devs involved, the game can be flipped on its head to add completely game-changing affects and items.",1578383014,1578383014

Also for a game like this, the CPU usage is extreme. Other games hum along on my system, but this one is constantly maxing out the CPU. Unfortunately the high resource usage impacts gameplay in that it causes negative actions to occur in the game. For instance, if the game freezes due to high resource usage, passengers miss their flights (because the clock does not freeze), so stats are negatively impacted due to no fault of the design of the airport.

I ended up downloading someones airport via workshop, and its really great to continue to improve their great content. I must say that is a plus. The developers are actively involved in trying to assist, and make the game better. Its refreshing to see designers,Publishers, and other players work together to make this game amazing.

 The game has potential, and I just feel like it needs to be worked on more to warrant my recommendation.

*  The game is too slow.  You often have to wait several days to get enough money to do anything, and you can't speed up the game time nearly enough.  
* Everything costs too much.  Building your airport costs way too much, loans cost way too much in interest for it to be useful.  You have to build offices and hire an expensive executive just to see basic profits and losses.  Stupid and pointless, why does this basic feature require so much?  You have to hire like 4 different executives to do basic research and it is prohibitively expensive.  I hate it and you get very little back in return for hiring all these people.  
* negotiations are overly complicated and stupid.  Again, you have to hire a ton of sales people, navigate a bunch of menus that are not clear or well laid out, satisfy a ton of expensive building conditions and finally they might get you more money if you've figured this all out properly.  I have no idea why this needs to be in the game, it's tedious and when you've finally done it, the extra money barely offsets the cost of hiring all these sales people.  Terrible, not fun and not interesting.  
* The graphics look really, really terrible.  I didn't expect or require the game to look very good but it's worse than I thought it would be.  I assume this will be improved eventually, because it's so absurdly bad right now.  The people in your airport look like paper dolls, instead of sitting down their torsos just lay on the chairs.
* Basic things require a ton of infrastructure.  For example, baggage.   You have to run belts from the ticket desks, move them underground, into a baggage hub with specific in and out ports, and then onto the wheel where it can be picked up.  This also requires you to build a bunch of expensive underground rooms and conveyor belt up/down sections and also you need an outdoor baggage thing that can ONLY connect underground and you need a vehicle hangar with baggage carts AND the carts need to be assigned to your gates.  Seriously, all this to move bags from A to B and it doesn't really seem to have much effect on efficiency.  
* After 20 hours, I added a second pick up area for people to use when leaving my airport. This was 100% needed, but it broke the game.  Passengers are able to use both pickup areas, I can see them using the things, but still half the people in my airport are getting stuck. Great.",1577474297,1577474297

I really love everything that Sim Airport has to offer. It is simple enough, that I don't need a Wiki page open next to me, just to play the game. However, also complex enough, that I don't find myself zoning out and watching Netflix instead of playing. The game is lacking a true Campaign, so if you're the kind of person who likes to complete and move on, you may find this game a bit tedious.

Pros: Huge sandbox potential. With over 50+hrs clocked already, I have barely moved past the opening tech, and am yet to really dive deep into late game mechanics. Game has huge logic puzzle style game play, that constantly has you thinking about your next step, and reworking your airport to allow for extensions and upgrades.

Cons: I enjoy a well thought out sandbox with good mechanics, but I also want it to look pretty; think Factorio. It frustrates me to no end, how ugly and grey the concrete walls are, and while we have so many options for flooring, a simple paintbrush wouldn't go astray for the walls. Also just simple things, like the way certain objects snap, depending on their angle. I always have to be so careful where I place bins, otherwise they look stupid.

I found this game very difficult to understand and didn't even complete the tutorial, and simulation/management games are my forte. The tutorial was quite wordy and possibly included information that wasn't amazingly important which led to information that probably was quite important being omitted. I could not get past a certain step in the tutorial, and I restarted to try again and still got stuck at the same point.

I thought a positive point of the game was that the developer was replying to reviews and really interested in improving the game. As you can see below, the developed asked me to email some more feedback points. I did this and the developer again responded asking for even further in depth answers and said that they'd give me a game key for the time spent giving them feedback. They stopped responding after that email and I never got the game key, this makes me sound slightly like a spoilt child but why offer something if you're not going to give it? I would have given the feedback regardless, but it's just poor professionalism to offer someone something and then not respond.

And that's on an overclocked 9700K (5.1Ghz) with 16GB of 4000MHz DDR4 RAM and an RTX 2080Ti. Unacceptable. 

If they can figure out how to make the game run smoothly once most of the map is covered with your airport, then I'd give it two thumbs up. Otherwise, it's fun for a bit and then gets unplayable the further along you get. I'm recommending it only because there's hope it might get better one day.",1575670324,1575670324

Airport design starts simple and then gets more complex; to get a very high capacity airport running smoothly, you really need to plan things out well ahead of time, but it's not difficult at all to get a basic small airport running profitably. 

The government grants set up nice mini-goals to try to meet, helping give incentive to try for a better, more complete airport rather than just thinking what you have is good enough.

Open-ended gameplay, which may or may not be what you're looking for. 

They've been working on the game and seem to have made notable improvements in how efficiently it runs. 

There are still a few frustrating bugs, but nothing that has stopped me from playing; usually an odd passenger getting stuck on the scenery somewhere. Once in a while a whole mess of employees and passengers will seem to malfunction, but when that's happened, saving and loading the game a couple of times seems to fix it and get things running smoothly again.

It's extremely satisfying seeing the streams of passengers flowing through your airport and bundling themselves into the planes or onto public transport.

Overall not a perfect game, but the devs seem to be working on it regularly, and if the genre strikes your fancy then I'd say it's a must-have already.",1574828470,1574828470

Imagine Prison Architect, but wayyyyy earlier on in development.  I spent about 8 hours taking my airport from nothing to finally turning some serious profits. I looked past all the minor bugs because I enjoy this type of game.  My enjoyment trumped the problems until It was time to expand my airport. I decided to finally buy the parcel of land beside mine to expand operations.  When I went to purchase the land I got one of the many empty dialogue boxes I had gotten used to in this game, so I clicked one of the wordless buttons.  This prompted the map to go blue and erase any trace of me ever having started an airport.  I don't think I'll be returning to the game any time soon knowing that all progress can be lost at pretty much anytime. Maybe I'll give it another shot once it's more polished.

I didn't want to start with the pre-fab career mode airport, so I selected to start building myself, still in career mode though..... of course my first airport was an utter failure, trying to figure everything out. Wiped the sheet clean, and started with a new airport. Second airport was a great success..... but of course I started with everything too small (especially security) because I only had limited funds, without really planning for the future, so I ended up doing major reconstruction almost constantly.... which is sort of like any real airport that wasn't built in the last 15 years or so!

This game is constant fun, but I like the sim/planning/building kind of games.

PROS: Endless building, ever-changing airports, nice mods to add airlines (although some are broken), LOTS of tutorials from fans on youtube. I have been hooked for days now, and I keep watching youtube videos of people playing it on my second monitor, learning from what they do. I love this game!

CONS: Some of the graphics need updating, there should be more objects (such as elevators, a burger joint). Passengers sometimes do completely illogical things.... but on their defense, they are just computer programs programmed to go from A to B, and if you are building something or leave an exposed door or hole in the wall somewhere.... they might just choose the TARMAC as their best route to get a DONUT! ;-)

WISHES: Build in international vs domestic zones, with passport control for international arrivals, adding an additional challenge in airport design.... where arriving passengers will have to queue up for customs.That would also mean you need a police zone and patrolling police officers - including a JAIL for passengers that have broken the law during flight or upon arrival. I would  also like to see multi-level arrivals/departures, where the drop-off zone is on floor 1 with raised roads, and the arrivals is on floor 0/G. This would help with separating passenger traffic. It may require separate pickup and drop off buses though....

BOTTOM LINE: If you like building sims AND you like airports and/or flying, this game is a big win.

Every basic function on this game is difficult and tedious:

-You need a masterclass in civil engineering to build a baggage network
-Travelers are always getting stuck, and getting them unstuck is a challenge.
-Give your guests any kind of amenities whatsoever, and they will miss their flights. Refuse to give them amenities, and they are unhappy.
-everything takes FOREVER to build, and if you make a mistake, it takes FOREVER to fix it.
-Seriously, everything takes too damn long! And if you hire 500 construction workers, they just get stuck
-Everything gets stuck - People, workers, delivery vehicles...
-The DEV's keep making changes that make it impossible to keep track of how to build an airport. For example, they add the multiple floor features, and now Aircraft Gate entrances are required to be on the second floor.

How do we make this better?
-Have an instant build mode. While its fun to watch construction workers scurry around, it literally takes as long to build a digital airport as it does to build a real one.
-Improve the AI of the travelers. I get that in real life people miss flights, but nobody sits in a cafe until their flights leave before storming out of the airport with an exclamation point over their head in real life.
-Allow for multiple drop off and pick up points for passengers, and make them assignable. Having multiple terminals for large airports is useless if people always arrive at the airport in the same spot.
-when building gates, we need to have the option to designate what floor it is on.

I usually like to wait until i've played a game for at least 5 hours before i write a review, unless it's really awful.  Let me start by saying the game is not awful, but some parts of it are.  Explanation: The tutorials.  They are all the proof people need that video games cause violence.  There ok, as long as you don't minimize the tutorial window.  If you do, you might not get it back open.  And, you have to minimize the tutorial window because the UI is extremely awkward (more on that in a minute).  Some of the tasks dont register as complete. so you have to skip it to get to the next step.  Some of the labeling is off, i spent 15 minutes looking for a window that was named something else, i found it by accident.  The UI: Ugh!  The UI is extremely clunky.  Windows don't size right, so you have to pull and drag to find the close button.  Some are so large, they take the entire screen.  I had three windows open, and i could not see any of my airport.  The clicking is not responsive at all.  I had to click options numerous times to select them, and right click numerous times to de-select.  The UI needs major work.  And unfortunately, thats all i have been able to do in almost fours of gameplay.  It seems fun, it looks fun, it might be fun.  But it needs work before it comes out of EA.  At its core, its prison architect.  So it really does have a lot of potential, its just not there right now.  As it sits, if you frustrate easy, rage quit a lot, steer clear of it while its in EA.  Read the updates, make sure they have fixed core issues before buying.  20 bucks is a steep price to pay for frustration and head scratching.  I can't in good faith say buy it until they have done a lot more polishing.  3rd quarter 2019 is coming fast, and i don't think they can make it.  I will re-evaluate in a couple months.

Edit:  130+ hrs later.  The game shares a lot of similarities with prison architect.  Like selling your airport and starting over.  I have built 4 increasingly larger terminals and reached a milestone of loading 8000 pax in a 24 hr period.  Its fun, but it is still frustrating.  I managed to shrink the boxes so that it actually fit on the screen, but it still seems pinched, and it still doesn't respond the way it should.  My current airport has six of each gate.  2 large and 2 XL are unused, or have been reserved as back up gates because there's simply not enough flights to fill every slot.  Thats with a 67% desirability rating.  Lots of small planes, not enough big ones.  I would make huge cafe's, and then only have them make less than 100 bucks a day, while the pax's hunger spiked ever upward.  I get  the terminal up to 80% approval, only to have it sink to below 72% in the hours of 2 am to 4 am.  Everything spikes, and the airport has zero pax's in it.  Their boredom is at a 60% approval and there seems no way to improve it, despite having newstands, vending machines, and shops.  By the way, they stop using the electronics vending machines entirely when you create newstands.  Its these little issues that kill the game and leave you asking why am i playing this?  So yeah 130+ hrs in, and it still needs quite a bit of polish and balancing.",1565842579,1567480404

Although it requires the usual logic in Tycoon games (especially when organizing luggage network between check in, gates and carousels) it's very much straightforward and most of the time is the game itself telling you what you're doing wrong.

Of course it's in development and above everything the devs are very present, answering to your requests or bug reports either in the discussion forums or even by mail.

- Larger map/land size, which would enable more realistic airport building.  This trickles down into the next points as well.
- Pickup/dropoff zones are just... there; there is no parking or airport services such as taxi or rental cars.  This is a critical part of any airport experience.  Buses and cars just pull up to drop off or pick up.  The only other transport option is rail.
- Airline maintenance hangars; should be a key part of ""trust"" with the airline.
- Private hangars

Now the painful part.

All aspects of building in this game are vastly over-complicated (not to be confused with complex / deep).  Want to build a PA system?  Get ready to tediously connect / assign things until you want to quit playing.  Want to build more foundation?  More frustration.  Simplify these systems!  The complexity of this game should lie in maximizing amenities, passenger arrivals / departures, and tending to airline needs and airport maintenance, and not in scouring YouTube for videos on how to automate baggage deliveries.

With an airport that maxes out around 4500-5000 passengers, having active construction at the same time bogs the game engine way down.  I have a Ryzen 2700x at 4.3ghz that sits around 50-55% usage when this occurs; this is even using RAM at 3600 speeds.  I'm not sure if the engine is limited to 4c/8t, but it comes nowhere close to 100% usage with what I consider to be a moderately sized operation.

Graphicly speaking its a good looking game, not Star Citizen level but fits the style and its not system intensive.  The game play mechanics (Im still learning)  are pretty nice. I can adjust my profit from things like ATM's and arcade games as well as just about everything else.  Building: This is a game where you dont just build a complete structure (some exceptions like the ATC tower), no, you build a foundation (with walls) then set the ""zone"" then build (using a bathroom as example)  toilets, sinks, urinals, trash cans etc.  EVERYTHING has a cost associated with it so spend wisely.  You can manage your staff in great detial if you like as well.  Bottom line is this....Its fun. Its not for everyone.  Give it a go and  maybe you'll have fun with it as well.",1565363212,1565363212

Too many times I tried to build something and it took down my entire airport saying the area was no longer secure when it was actually completely secure breaking my entire game causing immediate rage quit due to the stupidity of it all.

Also the variety of items to improve the airport are non-existent. This could be a good time, but the execution as it is now is just terrible.

I thought this would be awesome cause it has a good premise and I loved prison architect which this is very similar to. Just woefully worse in every conceivable way.

Even if you somehow decide not to build anymore because it will break your game, it takes months to make a few dollars. Very poor.

This is not a true to life, true to scale sim game. My play through of this game was fun, but majority of my play time is letting it run to earn money so I can make larger improvements to the airport. Although at this time there isn't much to this game, there is still plenty to do with the features that currently exist.

With a couple of test plays, I was able to get the hang of what was required to have a self sustaining airport. What I did wish for was more customizable items. However, with the workshop, it bring more items and planes available to make your airport feel different. 

I will come back to this game from time to time to see what updates that have brought to the game. Hopefully the devs keep expanding on the idea and eventually add subway systems to connect to airports, and maybe even helicoptors. 

I would recommend this game on sale. Not for the full price in it current develop stage, but it definitely is a fun time waster.

I got about 170 hours since the summer sale on this, and 8 hours on the other one. That kind a tells clearly which one is more fun for me. Main reasons why i love this game is that it has somehow more enjoyable game play. Graphics in many cases aren't quite there yet, but it has been well indicated that these are in some parts original alpha ""temporary"" things and will be sorted. Even with them, game is well enjoyable with fairly few bugs, and none being game breaking. 

If you are wondering which one to go for, i highly recommend this as it has better focus on what happens inside the terminal currently. External areas are slowly being added to catch up on that department. Remote gates are now active on Edge branch and will probably fairly soon be rolled over to main branch. Overall game is a lot less micromanaging compared to other title, which also contributes to the enjoyable game play.

Devs are very active and approachable on the forums, which definitely is a big plus. 

So, if you like customer flow management inside the terminal with lot of control over it and aren't too bothered how things look(Means that runway, taxiway and apron graphics aren't realistic looking at this date), this is definitely your game to get. 

If you are all about realistic looking exterior areas and micromanaging that side with less focus on the internal areas in the terminal, you might want to check the other one out. But for me, this game is a clear winner.",1564562722,1564562722

Trust goes to 0. This is a dumb mechanic that is stupidly sensitive and makes you wait AGES before you can do anything. You don't get extra flights, or they just get cancelled by airline right away, and you're stuck in a loophole trying to save up for ages. 

Also, the price of fuel to me is a bit off. One day it is 0.8 per litre, the next it is 1.7. I think they should be more stable instead of jumping up and down like a kangaroo. Makes Profits from fuel really difficult slowing any progress and having a dumb effect on trust as above. It feels so artificial. 

Finally, the conveyor system. Oh Christ did that make me just rage quit... I personally find the inability to connect the two way (which can be set to one way) to one way hub belt as dumb. Purely because you can turn it to be one way, so why can't you connect it to one? Makes extending the belts a lot harder and stupidly expensive, where the cash flow is very slow as you don't really get flights anyway without having fuel. Do you see the loophole here? I'd rather play the game than sit around staring at the monitor for ages trying to get some money to afford the slightest extension, or waiting 10 years to be able to afford some fuel. Seems artificially slow. You have to wait too long to do anything which makes the game boring once you get to around 5-6 gates.

Lacking a little bit of content (Could be expanded in future updates)
The A.I Can be dumb
Some systems are unnecessarily complex
First 5 hours of a game can be a bit dull
THE 10X SPEED OPTION IS NOT FAST ENOUGH

Construction categories can be confusing/misleading 
Item pricing needs balancing

While the game can be fun, its also lacking content. At first even with the tutorial it can be a bit overwhelming
when you are dipping into bankruptcy every night. A lot of the time you are just sitting and waiting for money
to be able to do something and the time speed options provided don't seem fast enough. The game is fully playable
and i haven't encountered anything game breaking yet or crashes. 
The game can be a good time sink, but right now i'd wait to pick it up on a sale.

But this game, at this stage, needs a UI overhaul because it's far too confusing. I'm even struggling to get through the tutorials. Let me provide an example of the absurdity. To get a simple PA system working, you have to put up speakers. Okay, that's about as far as that may need to go in many games. But in SimAirport you have to build an electrical room, a PA console, click the console and attach each individual speaker to the console. Okay, so now it's in the realm of the camera system of Prisoner Architect, one of the more complex systems of that game. Okay, that's it, right?

Nope. Now we have to click a GATE and link that gate back to the speaker system. Really? Not only does that seem to be a bit of busywork and unduly complex, it doesn't make sense that I have to click the console to attach the speakers but click the gate to attach that to the console. It's not consistent and it's probably far too complex for a simple system. 

I finally gave up on the tutorial for setting schedules. Okay, setting a schedule isn't all that easy - click the personnel button, click schedules, drag the hours on a green bar (rather than click or enter times), etc. But then I wanted to apply that schedule to actual people or locations...and couldn't find any place to do it. The tutorial doesn't say how to do it either. 

There's a great game here. I know it. But it's BURIED under layers of menus, inconsistent linking, unduly complex systems, poorly designed elements and confusing screens. For those who have been sticking it out these obstacles have been overcome and probably seem trivial.

The developers have really taken advantage of spending time in Early Access and been quick to respond to player feedback and have made significant improvements to the game since first release. They have created a game that's not just a solid 'management tycoon' but is, most importantly, great fun. On the surface it looks easy to play (creating your first airport is very straightforward) but underneath there is a vast array of calculations and decisions being made that offer a genuine challenge.

What makes the game particularly impressive is that pretty much all the information you need is provided in a plethora of tables, graphs and overlays. Want to know how the airlines feel about your fuel prices? Check the satisfaction ratings. Want to see where you passengers are going? Click on any sim and see their real-time desires, or check the global satisfaction graphs. Why are flights half-empty? Maybe your bus schedule can't cope with the numbers.

The feel is very similar to prison architect in terms of how it plays, but managing an airport instead.  It still has a few rough edges, but nothing game breaking at this point that gets in the way of the fun.  If you find yourself in a bugged out situation saving the game and reloading the save will generally fix it.

The game feels very realistic and gives you just enough to control and manage.  I would love to see them expand and add more depth and systems as time goes on.  In the mean time this game is a great time waster that sucks me in for hours at a time.

My wish list:
-Ability to build roads up in addition to down (e.g. 2nd level drop off, ticketing and check in)
-Music/Audio... this game desperately needs some good music and the sound effects are a bit meh
-Offer maintinence and catering services to airlines, similar to selling fuel
-Would be cool to have international flights with the need to clear customs, immigration, etc.

The game itself is some of the most fun I've had in a while, the mechanics can be a bit clunky at first but once you get used to it they're a lot of fun to play around with. Sandbox mode is especially fun, trying to find out how to make the most efficient version of whatever comes to mind (for example I'm currently using underground roads, buildings and tunnels to create an underground terminal with above ground gates to increase space for runways)

And the main reason I'm recommending this early-access game is that the developers are extremely active and responsive with the community, on the next level.  It's the equivalent of outstanding customer service.  The game is not perfect - they're still working on it.  But their work shows, and I'm glad to have been along for the ride.

Some tips:
- Parallelism.  Some things like security can be a real bottle-neck, if you don't have a wide enough band of parallel channels for the passengers to traverse.  You need deep parallelism in several places, since you can't do much about serial speed.
- Last release (April 2019) the passengers arrived thirsty.  New release (July 1, 2019) their big thing seems to be hunger, and a fool will miss his flight for want of a sandwich.  Put food vending machines EVERYWHERE when you get B-767's and larger. 
- The passengers still take the most peculiar paths, for no reason.  Don't worry, you're not doing it wrong.  (Unless you are doing it wrong, like not having a door in that one wall.)  It's still a work in progress.
- Fuel is profitable, but expensive to start up.  And maddening to watch the pricing flow.  For easier profits, turn that ""Terminal Usage Income"" up to at least $30.  I often have it at $40 or $50.  Don't go too high, but that one fee accounts for the lion's share of your income, especially as your flights get larger.
- Have fun! ^_^",1562048970,1562048970

[b]Long version:[/b]  

Pro:
- There is always something to improve / optimize / expand in your airport. Even after 60 hours I don’t even feel close to a perfect and smoothly running airport -> very long-time motivating, resulting in high value for your monies 
- If you like micro-management you will love this one. As an example: Every single trash can needs to be strategically placed.
- I’ve reported a bug in the forums, got an insta-response from a dev. And with a bit of delay the bug was fixed. :)

Contra (most of these can be considered normal for an EA title):

- Right now it’s imo too easy to swim in money, which can be nice if you just want to relax
- The graphic is a bit inconsistent and currently some animations / sprites look a bit off. But imo these kind of games are not about fancy graphics anyway
- A few minor bugs / AI issues that you probably won’t even notice

My personal wishlist, just because I can 😃 :

-	Ground personnel, including drivers for the vehicles pretty please!
-	More underground options (tunnels for vehicles would be great)
-	Please increase the range of PA speakers, and add a high-end system that could cover all your gates / gathering points and requires operator(s) to work. 
-	Parking lots & the necessary street / logistic network around it could  be a great additional feature too

I love the detailed gameplay, as well as how interlinked and interdependent everything is. It really provides for an interesting and dynamic playing experience. You have complete control over everything from your flight schedule, check in and security areas to full underground baggage networks, stores, cafés, and staff schedules. Over time you can expand both vertically, up and down, as well as buying new pieces of land. Combining all of this with the need to make as much money as possible, or at least a profit, creates a fun challenge that keeps you playing. They're also plenty of Workshop mods to make the game brands more realistic. I've never become bored with this game as there's always improvements to be made to your airport, or something new to try out. 

I think the devs are superb with their involvement in the community. New features are consistently being added all the time. I can honestly say that I've never been bothered by any major bugs in this game either, despite hours of play time and it still being in early access.

Main issues that still need improvement are number/diversity of objects you can build, graphics, and minor balancing concerns.

This game beats them all by far.  As an Air Force veteran, former air traffic controller and former airline employee, I am completely hooked on all things aviation and airport related.

If you'd like to build an airport from the ground up, every aspect of its operation, this game is for you.  If you like airplanes, building sims or managerial games, this game is for you.  The game is nearly bug free at this point.  I've built seven airports and its a different experience each time as this depends on how you set up your zones and aircraft operational area.  

Some game features:

Intersecting runways
Baggage handling and delivery systems
In terminal cafes and stores
PA system
Multiple floors, above and below ground.
Maintenance schedules on nearly every piece of equipment used by pax and aircraft
Fully customizable staff scheduling
Fully customizable queues for ticketing, security and other lines if you so choose.
Fully customizable aircraft gate scheduling including standby gate designation.
Aircraft refueling services with fuel storage and fuel price assignment and market value fluctuation.

The biggest challenges for me has been controlling the flow of passengers from pickup/dropoff to and from the terminal.  Also eliminating delays of aircraft on gates so that following flights are not delayed or cancelled when no standby gate is available.

This game is so customizable that its replay potential is practically endless.  Some might say that the scale size of people to the aircraft is way off, with the passengers being too big and the aircraft too small.  This is the only practical way to play the game.  If it was to scale, the constant need to zoom in and out would greatly hinder game performance and overall enjoyability.",1555720323,1555720920

Let me start by saying that I had trouble getting the game to run (outdated graphics drivers) and the support from the developers was excellent. 

At first glance the game appears simple however you quickly realize just how much there is to the game.  My first airport with only two gates and the first day of operations people were missing their flights right left and center.  Delays compounded and before you know it I had a flight crew stuck in a long security line so passengers couldn't even board the plane and the next thing you know it, the airline is cancelling the next flight scheduled for that gate.  That's it, I'm hooked! I just loved diving into figuring out how to get things up and running more smoothly.   And there are no quick fixes - before I could expand security I had to start by planning an expansion to my terminal. 

Throw in fuel delivery, scheduling, baggage systems, staff  schedules, restaurants, shopping, taxiway layouts and there is a lot to do here.  Let me give you the perfect example of the complex systems.  I'm waiting on the last flight of the night to depart - they have finally received their bags but are not pushing off the gate! Why not? My staff needs to go home.  Well they are so late that the runway is closed for it's scheduled nightly maintenance so there is no way for them to take off.  Cue panic while I figure out how to override the runway repairs (and turns out it could be done), get the flight out and then reclose the runway to complete the repairs in time for the morning arrival rush.

I can't wait to see where the dev team takes this.  The only thing I'd like to see at the moment is destinations for my flights (and arrival cities).  It would help breath more life into my airport.

Conceptually a great idea but I feel this deserves some flak for one big reason:

For a game two years past the original post date there are way too many bugs. Mostly this is a problem with the AI. *Examples I've seen include passengers (PAX) getting stuck behind walls or staff doors where there was recent construction (how and why is beyond me) and missing their flight, PAX wandering aimlessly never attempting to get to their flight after going to the washroom, and delivery zones filling up while idling workers fail to move excess stock to storage (or even move stock to where it could be needed). I honestly don't think the devs play their own game enough because in every playthrough you encounter a number of these bugs in my experience.

I am not including the annoying frequency at which the game outright crashes  (randomly) on this list because it probably has something to do with my platform (Fedora 29) and I can't reasonably expect devs to cater to my specific setup (although this issue seems specific to SimAirport). It also seems to increasingly eat up more and more spare memory (and slow to a crawl) as it runs which leads me to believe the engine doesn't properly free memory when it destroys objects.

Now, I know bugs are just part of any piece of software, however when obvious game breaking bugs like the ones above persist over a long period of time and aren't fixed in updates while new features are added then it says a lot about developer priorities.
I mean I really like that I can build roads underground now and that, in my current playthrough, my deliveries zone is underground as well.. but the fact that workers won't move any of the excess inventory out of the delivery zone into storage (where there is PLENTY of room) means I can't even expand the delivery zone to compensate for the lack of room in the delivery zone rendering the playthrough effectively broken.

That being said, I'm still going to play the game since I already own it. It's still fun when it does work, but I really wish I could get further through the game without encountering an unrecoverable problem which forces a restart.",1552762018,1552762018

  the only things i did not really like was the lack of control over employees. you can't have multiple shifts you can stop certain workers from working during periods of the day but its not like another employee will replace another if they left. and there is a lack in things like convyors are basic and same goes for security they do not really do anything it would be nice if they added a contraband system and a airport jail for any unruly paxs.",1552493139,1552493139

After only 8 hours of play I feel this game, and developer deserve it. I love business sims, and I love airplanes and flying sims. Nobody has combined them well for about 2 decades or more, until SimAirport. I played the very first airport sim game a long time ago on super nintendo I think, and haven't enjoyed one since, until now. 
  I was gonna try either SimAirport, or that other one people have been comparing it with. I was not sure which one would be better so I read a lot of reviews, A LOT. I watched some game play too and they both seemed like they might be alright. Than I noticed that the developer of this game was very much involved with watching the reviews, listening to the players, explaining things, telling the players why he did some things the way he did. I never seen one developer response on the other game, not one. And knowing what an airplane nut the developer is, like me, made me pleased to know he would make the game as realistic as he could. And he has done a great job on this I think. The pax AI is way more complicated than what meets the eye, which I love. I wish there was a little more reports, financial break downs, and what not, but there might be a few I haven't seen yet, or maybe will be added later. Love the game so far, and if you are on the fence between the 2 games, I recommend this one highly. It seems the developer really cares about it too, and that goes a long ways these days.

Update: After playing the game for a few more hours I found out that after hiring a CFO, all the financial reports I was hoping for are available in the game. There is detailed breakdowns of everything, reports and at least one graph, I love that stuff!! :P Still really enjoying the game. It is one of them where I lay in bed and think about layouts, better pax flow, increasing revenue, better runway layouts, expanding, and on and on and on. I figured out the ques, and really enjoy that feature also. Really good game for a really good price.",1552475630,1552654515

I guess only the start is a bit hard since the initial setting´s of the airport are set up in a way which makes it very hard to get any substantial income - basically you need to raise the price for airlines quite a lot and you´ll make more than enough money. Also you can decrease the time a flight gets for being handled and then offset the flight times a little bit that allows you to run 9 flights on 2 gates (18 total) without too big bottlenecks. 

This is a game that will absolutely run alone for quite a while once the airport is running half way straight without constant micromanagement like for example in Rimworld so really something nice to have to run on the side while working on something else or watching a movie. (just at the start having way too little funds can be taxing because nothing is happening in quite a while especially if you haven't figured out my tips from above and don't hire the managers to early since they are really expensive at the start) 

I guess the easiest fix to make the game more accessible would be to have the airline costs run dynamic & automatic  in a similar order like the fuel selling (also automatically buying fuel can send you into bankruptcy quite easy. 

Another point is - if you run into the red a bank loan can easily save you even if the interests are high - in most other games going into debt just prolongs the suffering or kills you straight away so that's quite interesting to have that option actually working. 

On a negative note - if you figured out the economics you´ll have way too much cash on hand but getting several A380 running smoothly at once through the airport is still quite a challenge.

1) The scaling is all off. You need way too many runways and security to handle the gates. You can see for yourself if you check out the workshop. You'll see the people posting airports have insane numbers of checkpoints and runways for a very small number of gates. There's one guy with 47 checkpoints and four runways for 14 gates. In real life, a major airport like DCA can easily operate 40+ gates with two runways and one or two checkpoints with 2-4 scanners each.

2) The size of the people is also wrong. They are way too big in comparison to the planes so your terminals have to be huge if you want to fit a realistic number of seats at the gates. This is a leftover problem with the prison architect assets I think.

3) The airline contracting and scheduling part is very weak. You basically just drag and drop aircraft from various airlines into time slots. It doesn't even tell you where the flights are coming from (nor does your airport exist on the world map). There should be master contracts and the whole system should be a lot more exciting as you build relationships with certain airlines and get offered bigger planes. For example, you could become a hub for an airline. Airline Tycoon, despite being terrible, did this much better 15+ years ago. The little beeper would go off and you'd get all excited wondering what kind of new contract was being offered.

Having already spent over 280 hours in Airport CEO, I was naturally curious to see how SimAirport differed, and whether it stood up to the competition set by ACEO.

My decision to finally purchase SimAirport was prompted by seeing the dev team respond to criticism on Steam. You could tell by their response that they have great pride in their game, and it translates within the gameplay. Further, I did encounter a minor bug within the refueling system, and sent the devs an email seeking clarification. Less than 24 hours later I had a long, detailed reply from the devs explaining what caused the bug, and precisely detailing the fix they would make in the next update to overcome the issue. This left me with such a positive impression, that I thought I'd write this review praising their attention to detail and great customer service - well done, guys, you're doing an excellent job!

The gameplay itself is very enjoyable, and recreates the same sense of creativity/excitement that I once experienced within Prison Architect - the construction of walls, and the placement of objects feels very similar. Truthfully, I had such great fun seeing my first attempt at an airport successfully deal with the overwhelming flow of passengers, that I simply sat and watched the airport in awe, afraid to tweak what I saw as perfection in my planning! When I did eventually tire with the limitations of what I'd built, I 'sold' my airport (excellent move to include a career mode, devs!) for 86 million, and started building a super-sized airport that could deal with three times the passenger numbers. I'm still building that airport at present, aided by the proceeds of that 86 million, but with multi-floor availability and moving walkways, you never really need worry about passengers taking too long to reach departure gates. Even if you do have a gate situated miles away from the checkin desks, you can expand the duration that an aircraft is scheduled to be at your airport. This means that you can almost always hit your performance bonuses, and keep passengers and airlines happy (note to the devs: the decision to increase/decrease the time an aircraft sits at your airport - by dragging the slider - is frankly genius).

In researching the game, before making the decision to buy, I watched many videos of gameplay and looked at many screenshots (some of which are on Steam). Many of those, I suspect, were done from an earlier build, and don't seem to pay justice to the graphics, nor environment created within this game.

In closing, I look forward to seeing how this game develops, and must offer my heartiest congratulations to the devs for their tenacity. I'm off now, to carry on building 'Tigglefish Intl Airport'. Wish me luck!",1546534608,1546534608

[h1]Construction[/h1]
AirportCEO has you hire a contractor for your construction, and this contractor has a limited number of workers which you can utilize. When you're done with a project, you can simply dismiss your contractors and they'll leave the site. You keep your contract and can call them back whenever you need them. Interior construction is on what appears to be a 1 m square grid and external construction [i]and foundations[/i] use a 4 m square grid. Especially if far away from the contractors' offload site (where they go when inactive) more than 50 contractors are needed to complete even moderately sized projects quickly. Unfortunately there's no way to expand the pool of contractors since you can't sign multiple contracts at once even though it would be quite useful from time to time.

SimAirport has you hire workmen directly. This invokes a hiring cost and to have them leave the site requires you to pay a termination cost. This is because your workmen also have functions as full time staff, being the workers that perform maintenance of your airport. Airport CEO has you hire separate service technicians for maintenance. Except for large projects, you should never need more than 30 workmen to have a project done fairly quickly, though this is in-part due to the reduced airfield scale. SimAirport uses what appears to be a 1 m grid for interior construction [i]and foundations[/i] and a 10 m grid for exterior construction.

SimAirport has planning tools to help you design your airport before spending any money on a project. These tools should really be in Airport CEO too. In addition, you can cancel work orders with a right click whereas the only way to cancel construction in Airport CEO is with the bulldozer tool.

[b]Winner: SimAirport[/b]

[h1]Terminal Customization[/h1]
Airport CEO gives you basic elements of a terminal that are necessary:
[list]
[*]2 gate seats
[*]Smaller, less sophisticated and larger, more sophisticated security checkpoints
[*]16 floor types
[*]Custom shop/food shop objects
[/list]
SimAirport gives you more elements to customize your airport and makes it feel more alive:
[list]
[*]3 types of gate seats in 3 sizes (for types B and C)
[*]Metal detectors, baggage scanners, ID check stands, and full body scanners to design your security checkpoint how you want it
[*]Automated ticketing kiosks in addition to the staffed check-in desks, for those without checked luggage
[*]52 floor types, though a couple are duplicates
[*][b]Multistory terminals[/b] (in development for Airport CEO as well), up to 3 stories above ground and 2 basement floors
[*]Standalone food kiosks as well as custom shop/restaurant construction tools, including a behind-the-scenes airport kitchen
[*]Moving sidewalks
[*]Escalators (though no elevators for some reason)
[*]Flight status boards and info kiosks
[*]Queues that can be assigned to multiple objects (e.g. a queue for multiple ticketing desks)
[*]First class and flight crew lounges
[*]And more!
[/list]
The big complaint I have for SimAirport is that we can't make a skybridge for airplanes to taxi underneath while connecting the terminal overhead. All foundations down to ground level have to exist to build up a new floor.

[b]Winner: SimAirport[/b]

[h1]Airfield Customization[/h1]
Airport CEO uses a scale for its aircraft that appears 1:1 in comparison to the terminal. It uses what appears to be 4 m grid for airfield elements like stands/gates, runways, and service roads. Your airport can begin by servicing General Aviation (GA) airplanes using only a grass runway, grass taxiways, and grass stands. You can then upgrade the airport with at terminal, paved runways and taxiways, and eventually, larger, paved gates with jetways. Service roads can mapped ontop of taxiway foundations, allowing a service road to cross or run on a taxiway.

In addition to gates, you can also have remote stands for your commercial flights, where an airside shuttle carries your pax from the gate desk to the airplane elsewhere on the airfield. And with GA in this game, your commercial ops aren't the only thing keeping your huge airport busy. That said, expansion of your airfield is limited; you start with the southwest quarter of the land and can only expand buy buying another even quarter.

SimAirport appears to use a 10 m grid for exterior construction. This grid is large enough for the width of an entire taxiway or runway, and a small gate only uses a 2x2 space. This does, however, impact the scale of the aircraft. Even an A350 which has a 6 m exterior diameter is less than 3 m wide in SimAirport. The longest a runway ever needs to be, even to handle XL aircraft, is only 240 m long, hardly realistic for jumbo jets that rarely take off from runways less than 7000 ft (2100 m) long (though with the ~1/2 scale aircraft, only ~1000 m. Service roads can be built in SimAirport, but vehicles will just follow the taxiways if they're the fastest route.

Land expansion is more granular than Airport CEO, letting you buy strips of land bordering your existing property on any side you wish until you reach the maximum land size. Though with the light rail and road bordering your west edge and the limit to only 1 dropoff and 1 pickup zone, your options for westward expansion are pretty limited.

[b]Winner: Airport CEO[/b]

[h1]Management/Gameplay[/h1]
Both games feature a career mode with unlockable elements and a constrained cashflow. Airport CEO requires you to research through the Procurement menu, the same menu used for vehicle acquisitions, and does not reveal new technologies until you unlock their prerequesites. SimAirport uses a tech tree that maps out all your research right from the start. There is more to research in Airport CEO, in part because some elements that are locked in Airport CEO are unlocked from the start in SimAirport.

The Conveyor systems of the two games are both functional, but in different ways. Given SimAirport's multistory terminal construction options, you can do more with conveyors in SimAirport than Airport CEO, but expect that to change once Airport CEO gets multistory terminals. I will say that I prefer the tip-tray idea used by Airport CEO becuase it's more realistic.

Both games have a lot of waiting. If you're cash-strapped, a loan (pick from a few sizes in Airport CEO or specify loan size in SimAirport) can get your airport moving quickly again, but if you have the time to walk away and let your airport make marginal profit, there's no reason not to. Probably 60% of my logged SimAirport time is AFK for that reason. Construction is another reason to be AFK, though mainly in Airport CEO sandbox mode.

[b]Winner: Draw[/b]

[h1]Performance[/h1]
With a system spec of a 4 core i5 4690k and a GTX 970, SimAirport uses at most 65% of the CPU and can dip down to below 10% during the quieter parts of a medium-sized airport's day.

AirportCEO utilizes the entire overhead of my CPU to run, for some reason still consuming 70% of the CPU even with time paused. Changing the render quality had no noticeable effect on this, but you will likely notice a difference if running Airport CEO on a computer with integrated graphics. [u]The pathfinding is very unstable and can brick an airport permanently.[/u]

[b]Winner: SimAirport[/b]

[h1]Miscellaneous[/h1]
SimAirport: The keybinding page is unusually designed. Instead of giving each of the actions and showing the bound key, SimAirport shows the keys in alphabetical order and then has you choose the action bound to it from a dropdown menu. The camera pan speed is fixed at a set (and quite slow) speed as opposed to scaling the speed based on zoom level; this makes panning the camera almost irrelevant as it is far quicker to zoom out then move the cursor where you want to look and zoom in again (Also, zoom only centers on the mouse pointer when zooming in...).

Pros: 

-Fun Game once you learn how to play.
-Holds your attention.
-Good building design and efficiency is important and I like that.  I hate builders where you can build just about anything anywhere and you'll still be successful - This is not one of those games.
-Music and in game sound effects are not annoying.  (Only early access game I can say that about)
-Can start with nothing if you so choose to and build from scratch.
-It's just fun to play.

Cons:

-STEEP learning curve.  No tutorial, not all items have tool tips, some descriptions are misleading or confusing such as the explanation for multilane access research.  (Led me to believe the second road would start from the bottom and not from the top like the original single road you start with)
-Slow Pace - Even the fastest speed setting feels slow... but at the same time it doesnt feel slow...  If that makes sense.  The slower time scales compared to other games even at the highest speed setting make for long periods where you're just letting the game run, but at the same time the time scales seem realistic.
-Certain zones you're limitied to only one each. 
-Minor glitches.  I've had situations where all my PAX seem to be blocked by an imaginary wall.  Would NOT pass through a hallway leading to terminals, they all buned up at the beginning of it.  (Saving and reloading always fixes PAX glitches).  Had a few issues where after saving, text popup windows (like for quitting the game) are completely blank without text, even the ""Main/Quit/Cancel"" buttons wont have text in them.


Suggestions for developers:

-Fastest speed just slightly faster please?
-I can see why maybe limited to only one pickup/dropoff zone as more could cause PAX routing issues but can I has second Maintenance zone?
-Want to be able to place/move spawn points for the roads myself.  Like maybe move the light rail line over to the right just a couple tiles so I dont have to buy a land expansion just for the station.
-Would like to be able to deactivate objects PAX use like ticketing gates and security objects.  Was building a new arrivals terminal and all my staff and customers were going to those ticketing gates even though I didnt have them connected to baggage yet and they werent even in an area zoned for Ticketing.  Would like to be able to build them and then disable them until they're ready to be used.
-Dismantling objects makes sense for larger items and buildings but for things like garbage bins and plants and stuff I feel like there should be just a simple move option instead.
-I would like graphs and more visual representations for everything happening in my airport.  Also notifications should be improved for important things like not waiting until your runway is at 5% maintenance before putting the !!! notification near the wind speed thing.  Maybe rework the budget screens a bit better.  Took me a while to figure out that a number in parentheses was supposed to mean negative number.  Should put either a - before the number or just change their colors so any positive numbers are green and negative numbers are red.
-The Career/Sandbox options seem redundant.  Really what you're picking is the option to either start with a different map size or make it so you have unlimited money.  Could eliminate both options and just open up money/map options for a single new game selection menu.  What if I want to start on a larger map but I dont want to feel like a cheater and be forced to have unlimited money along with that?",1546410321,1546806699

Main issue: The trash truck got stuck on the way to pick up trash. Incoming road to airport was single lane (never an issue before).

Love the game, but a tutorial, as well as an “action” button that can cancel a units actions, would be the most helpful.

Other things would be the cash register glitch. When in a cafe zone, it says it needs to be in a kitchen zone, and vice versa. Another issue is the zooming in and out with the mouse. There is not enough options, and the zoom goes from far away view to RIGHT UP CLOSE view with no middle ground.

The first thing I noticed was that there are certainly lots of options and menus to provide you with tons of information and choices for construction, so for a real hardcore airport guy you will likely love this. This game definitely dives in very heavy on the simulation aspect. I probably could have loved it too since I usually enjoy complex games, but there just was not quite enough immediate feedback/information to help me get off the ground satisfactorily and having fun. 

So I sat there and wondered, what the heck do I do? I guess I should schedule some flights. And so I did, and so they came. Seemed like it was the right thing to do but who knows. I fumbled around wondering what to do thereafter, unfortunately not having much fun meanwhile.

Suffice it to say there was little in the way of tooltips for me to figure out what I should do first, or next. Be prepared for a lot of trial an error. It took me about 5 minutes just to figure out how to set up a working queue. After building a few things that I thought would help my passengers enjoy themselves I had to later dismantle them because they werent in the right designated area (drink machine, really??). 

I dont usually mind trial an error--but that leads me to the next thing that turned me off--the pace. I did not get any timely feedback for my errors (e.g. the drink machine at the gate) until long after I made them. The pacing of this game is really slow to start out. The fastest simulation speed still makes building stuff feel like ages and nights feel like eons, at least early on when you don't seem to have access to overnight flights and there's not much to do, besides watch your construction workers go to work. And that's the last area that really disappointed me.

The priority given to visuals is unusually low. Quite a bit lower than the average for this type of game these days. I really did not want to watch my construction workers do anything. Not shuffle across the terminal with a box floating magically in front of them, or other staff driving their golf carts over the ticket booths to drop off people, or the 30 people getting off the plane all on the same tile, exhibting only one of only two apparent animations (standing or walking). Heck the passengers won't even take a seat on the gate benches--they literally stand on their seats. 

Maybe this is on me for not knowing this is the sort of game I was getting into in advance of buying, but it really turned me off since one of the things I enjoy about these sorts of games is watching the workers/customers interact and go about their business in some believable way.

Maybe you will overlook my gripes and will really enjoy the game. If these things are not important to you and you dont mind a real challenge/serious simulation experience, you just want to build a big terminal and manage lots of people and flights, and have lots of time on your hands, I am sure you will love it.

The biggest frustration for me is that the road (which runs continuously across the map, with the tunnel up top) is completely unecessary. It would be perfect if the game just let us designate ANY part of the map as the point where the vehicles appear out of the tunnel - which would then allow us to build our runways freely and have the traffic appear in the middle (much like London Heathrow, Terminals 1-3).

The second thing that is pretty annoying is the size and lack of flexibility for taxiways and gates. Taxiways in particular are laughable. They are the same width as the runway, which is ridiculous (in the real world, taxiways are more like a 1/3 of the runway width). Add that to the fact that you only have 4 directions you can build them in, and you may as well just build your entire airport out of runway. Very tedious and it's like you're using Lego bricks to build with...

You can see in the workshop just how many of the airport contributions look almost exactly the same. It's a real shame that this game has clearly been influenced by a certain architect game, and the result is one where creativity is stifled. This ends up leaning more towards a 'Terminal Architect' game than an 'Airport Architect'.",1542838672,1542838759

That is not a reflection on the game at all; I just haven't had time to focus on a new sim title.

Since I acquired this title, there have been many, many updates with three streams - the ""Default"", ""Experimental"" and (bleeding) ""Edge"" versions. Accompanying each update are detailed notes on changes and bug fixes, and there is a well-maintained timeline for future development. The player responses reflect this effort as the game's rating has risen significantly in recent months, with more recent reviews trending to ""Very Positive"". The process reminds me a lot of what I saw with Prison Architect and Kerbal Space Program, both of which are models for how ""early access"" should be done.

This is an early access title that has some obvious features planned for the future right in the item count and way you set things up. I can't wait to use them. If you like sim games, airplanes and mostly intuitive features this game is for you!

The AI is fairly smart at moving people, planes and equipment trucks around your airport. The most difficult portion to setup is baggage, but once you figure it out it's easy. If you have a profitable airport but think you can make it better you can sell your airport and start from scratch. It's basicly like selling something in real life, you lose your old airport (You can keep playing that save though with no problems) and you gain money from the entire thing. in 1 day of play I have sold a 3.5 mill airport and built up another worth 10 million!

The great thing about doing that is you see the flaws in basic design from your last airports and you are able to fix them with not losing any money at all!

Over the last 35yrs, I have played alot of tycoon games, some being Railway Tcoon Series and Sim City, and  Others along that long.
Since I purchased the Early access  game SimAirport I have not played others as I would have done normally,
This game keeps you busy, thinking, planning, strategy, costs, and operating it all, including Hiring and firing staff.

What i did not enjoy from the whole game is the price of it,
I did however and still do, as of writing this review, enjoy the game immensely and it is a real mind game.
not as easy as some other games sure, but who likes an easy tycoon game?

There are few mods ( In their early phases ) and several types of play.
You Have the 2 Basics, Career  and Sandbox................
Then comes the bonus of it, You get to choose whether you want to 
play the 2 basics as 1-Default Setting ( Which implies you need to wait for 
updates etc )
2-Experimental ( Implies you get to toy with, use, and report on bugs in anything
new that is going into the next update )
3-Become an Edge player and be able to submit bug reports, improvement idea's,
Suggestions, Thoughts, and  Try out the latest release items before they go into
the next update.........Generally help the developers fix anything wrong.

Now if that don't pique your interest, I do not know what will..............

SimAirport, one of the Best tycoon styled games that is the latest and maybe
to be one of the best.

Once you pay for the Early Access, everything else is free, apart from using some
brain cells to play a great game that you will lose hours upon hours playing and enjoying.

Do yourself a favour and get it now, price will only go up as it get's better and better.

However, everything is not perfect and dreamlike. There are some limited bugs or maybe a feeling of slight incompleteness. Being early access this is to be expected, even warranted. It's better and more fun to watch the process and to have input on the process to make a finished game.

Too many 'sim games' in the last 15 years have tried to maximize graphics while black-boxing too much of the challenging parts that make a game worth really getting into, all the while hindering game performance once things got going (and there are too many graphics to process). So, no, this game isn't super pretty in everyway, but it isn't all that bad either.

Some reviews complain about it being a difficult game to figure out. I didn't think this was too bad -- there are lots of notifications and 'alarms' in the game that tell you what needs to be done. It does help to have an idea of airport logistics, but this is a Steam game people -- there is literally an entire 'community' page where people post tutorials and guides and answer questions. If you really think it is that hard, have you ever played a Sim game before?? Are you sure this is your type of genre?? I played 'career mode' on a fresh map yesterday and I got a functional airport after tinkering around for about 45 minutes. What makes the game great is 14 hours later I am still learning new functionalities and components (fuel systems, electrical systems, food systems) while getting much more into the nitty gritty of aesthetics.

First, if you like these kinds of simulations both will draw you in for several hours. Both have an addictive quality which centers around the growth and management of your airport. I would say that SA is more like SimCity in nature and presentation. Neither of the graphics from these programs will wow you and SA, though it has unmistakable characteristics of the SimCity genre does not come close in graphics to that latest incarnation. The graphics are somewhat cartoonish particularly the people.In fact this and Airport CEO should be excoriated for having these ridiculous cut out sprites with a couple of animations. If  building games like PlanetCoaster, Transport Fever and numerous other sim building games can have nicely  animated people then so should these two culprits. These lack any real animation except in the most primitive style  qua 80's style. To the extent that SA's forte is the creation and growth of your airport this is somewhat mitigated because it will definitely draw you in and make the weird characters running around your airport less of a distraction. I think.

Second, the depth of the simulation is about the same as AC though I would say AC depends on much more direct management input and involvement, Both will require you to hire the executives and management though but either have different methods of implementing their tasks. In SA buying each one of the management will allow you to open up a string of enhancements for your airport. In AC hiring managment will also do the same such as a COO might have the ability to get enhanced procurements. In AC you enter into various contracts with the airlines or fuel companies which you can terminate if they don't live up to their obligations. In SA you simply take from a list of airlines and drop and drag their planes into your schedule. In AC you enter into a contract then you have the option of manually scheduling or letting someone from the executive do it automatically. 

As you make more money, you grow and enhance your airport in terms of bigger gates/jetways, ramps. Shops, furniture, security apparatus - it's all there in both games. In SA it seems there are a lot more things and variety of things than in AC.  Again, in either or both you can't go wrong. Except......

Once you have enhanced your airport (and this is like AC): I had three runways, grew out my terminal to accept heavies, more shops etc. etc. - the dreaded stuttering occurs. Just like AC. To the point it almost becomes unplayeable. For example, in SA I was digging underground laying pipes for fuel attaching them to the gates and the amount of stuttering was maddening as the workers were digging and laying pipe. In fact, construction seems to be the major culprit because once released  from the construction things become more manageable. But this effects the flow of the entire game and appears to have deliterious effects. A suggestion might be to show the workers arriving but have instantaneous construction as an option. Laying big foundations, long walls or pipes is just too much for the entire game making it unplayeable at these points. If it can't be optimized give the option for instantaneous construction. 

 In the second day of having purchased this game (career mode)  I was able to get a consistent cashflow of over 5.5 million and I so much wanted to buy some more adjoining properties for greater growth but the stuttering was so problematic the enjoyment proprotionately lessened.  This is a serious problem for both games. So be forewarned. I have a very good system (i7-7700k OC'd 4.7 GHz,   Asus Prime Z270-A MOBO ,32 GB DDR4 Ripjaws, ZOTAC ampExtreme 1080 8GB,  Thermaltake Core V71 Case, Corsair H100i v2 liquid cooler, RM850xCorsair psu, ADATA M.2 2280 240GB SATA III TLC Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) WIndows 10 Pro, 2 TB Samsung and 3 TB WD HDs ) but the stuttering will starch you and your system.

Maybe I'm biased since I love airports and planes and flight, but I recommend this game. Just two things.

Lack of a proper tutorial

There is no tutorial in this game. The help button in the top left simply tells you key bindings, and doesn't actually teach you the mechanics of the game, even in the most simplest form. There are outside resources that you can use, but it is always better, in my opinion, to have such information available in-game. Some of the systems are straightforward, but some are just downright confusing, which can be frustrating. A prime example would be the baggage system. If you want to play this game and really build up a busy airport, then you'll want to sit down and watch a few tutorials on YouTube or something.

Information Clarification

What information is presented to you in-game is somewhat unclear. A good example would be passenger satisfaction. You'll see that Frustration is at 95%. What does that mean? Does that mean they are 95% frustrated? Are 95% of all passengers frustrated? I don't have a clear answer myself.

This game is early access so it does get the benefit of the doubt, however I am reviewing the current edition to help you decide whether its worth playing now or waiting for it to update, if there's one thing to note this game has it's potential.

It's an Airport simulator so you would expect some form of that, what you get right now is very basic and very repetitive, it's fun for probably about 40 hours before you get to the point where you are just going through the motions to make a bigger and bigger Airport.

I hear you say ""but that's what it's about!"", not even in the slightest, I've known, worked with, been in and worked on airports and I can say with 100% certainty that this game is an understatement to managing or being a part of an airport.

I'll give you examples.

[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]

So building an airport is actually one of the few things that is relatively decent in this game, you have to be mindful at all times of what you are doing and planning ahead is important, some mechanics in the game also require you to learn from doing because it's inherently broken, for example cafeterias are the bane of the game.

The issue with them is that they take priority on satisfying all needs and so in a big airport everyone heads for them, and what you get are massive queues of people standing around, build drinks machines or kiosks it doesn't matter people will just ignore them and continue to build the queues on the cafe.

A simplistic bit of code could prevent this (i.e. limiting queue sizes) but unfortunately we have to wait for a bigger update which is meant to address this issue.

However most other issues aren't too drastic, and so don't impede on building the airport in any serious ways, it just depends on how complex you are willing to go, to be frank simplicity is the key here.

Another example would be passengers bugging out and preventing the plane from taking off, so it just sits there waiting until you force departure.

[h1]Flight Management[/h1]

Which brings me onto the actual flight management, it's very simple at the moment, flights are organised into AM, AN (afternoon), PM and EAM (Early AM), and an Airline company will give you flights depending on those timed zones, it’s up to you to put them when you want them to arrive/depart.

The issue here is right now it’s very one dimensional, there isn’t a weekly or monthly schedule, and flights are just assumed to take exactly 24 hours before they arrive back in your airport.

And the planes aren’t named or marked so you can’t even track them that way, you also can’t have airlines setup home in your airport, often airlines in RL will leave their assets in an airport and rent space to hold them on.

And to top it off the costs to airlines for using your facilities is one slider, there’s no negotiation or difference per airline, it’s a set cost for all airlines which simplifies it but ultimately removes some of the management from the game.

You can also forget anything like private planes or anything but passenger airlines, there are no commercial airlines such as transporting goods, and there is no involvement on the ATC except opening up more flights per day.

[h1]Summary[/h1]

Overall I would say this is primarily an airport builder, and not even a very good one which might sound harsh but for example it’s limited by relatively simplistic mechanics, you can make some logically sound airports, but they won’t be very iconic looking without a stretch of the imagination.

I will keep my eye on it, but for now if you are thinking this is going to be a complex airport simulator think again, it needs a lot more time in development.

What we have here is a very basic tycoon type game, you could replace the airport and planes with pretty much anything and name it something else and it would be compatible, there is very little here to suggest its an airport sim except the planes.",1532451829,1532452003

1) Transportation (highway, airport rail, light rail, roads with bridges, taxi etc.) for expanding from small airport to local airport (not yet at the International Airport state)
2) Immigration and customs (for International travelers)
3) Hotel and overnight (passengers missed a flight should stay in the airport and wait for the next one, or with hotel)
4) Frieght (a separate section for cargoods, express delivery, etc., may require customs)
5) Multiple terminals
6) Transfer (luggage delivery to another port, while passengers stays)
7) Retail rental shops (duty free, wine, local chocolate/gift) that you don't need to know what they are selling, but renting the location for profit
8) Overnight parking, garage/hangar, maintenance and opteration for automatically using another gate (grouping the gates, instead of standby option).
9) Disaster / emergency services (firefighter, police, embulance, helicopter, rescue services, army / united nation) for additional services (government contracts)

Profit margin should be a little bit more with less passengers on flight (only a few flights would have full passengers in reality, Monday to Thrusday flights may not have too many passengers, and they can take the next flight when delay).

Currently, the major revenue/profit I got is from selling gas, and I wish there is a way to speed up even faster, as half of my time is to wait for getting more profit to build new things.  I wish the focus would rather spend on managing customers (money should not be the only measurement, and should have different style of a successful airport design)

Meanwhile, I enjoy the points system for airport rating (and the consequences), wish there would be more to increase the challenge (easy level with lower satisfactions).

==[Graphics]==
☐ Potato
☐ Really bad
☐ Bad
☑OK
☐ Good 
☐ Beautiful 
☐ Masterpiece

Standard top down graphics for a tycoon type simulation.  They're not ""knock your socks off"" beautiful, but pretty decent for an early release game.  Also means that the game isn't resource intensive, and I think that's just the way games in this category should be, accessible to all games with any type of PC.

===[ $ Price/quality: ]=== 
☑ Full price
☐Wait for sale
☐Average
☐ Refund it if you can
☐ Don't do it

The price is worth it.  Since this game is in early access, it's constantly recieving updates packed with new features.  You also have the ability to download the newest releases of the game before they're a fully stable build.  I haven't tried this yet, but might give it a shot in the future.  There's alot of potential and extra content available.

===[ ☣ Requirments: ]=== 
☐ 90' PC
☑Minimum
☑Medium 
☐Fast
☐ High end 
☐ NASA computer

I had no issues playing this game with a rig that has a 1060 Ti, 8GB RAM, i5 4440, installed on a HDD (not SSD).  Even when the airport would fill to the brim with passengers, the game still played flawlessly at max fps.

===[ ☼ Difficulty: ]=== 
☐ You just need 2 arms 
☐Ez
☐Easy to learn / Hard to master 
☑ Hard (first few hours)
☐ Dark Souls

There's no tutorial developed yet (but I hear it's coming).  You do have to rely on YouTube for game tips, or in cases when you're stuck.  I couldn't figure out how to get a baggage system to work, but quickly figured out watching 10 minutes of a YouTube video.  I was humming along after about an hour or so.  

Feedback for the devs on difficulty is maybe look at having different ""sim"" levels (hardcore, arcade etc).  For example, an option in game to simply place a baggage carosel and not needing to connect it to the rest of the system.  So it's placed then pretty much just works.   

===[ ۞ Game time/length ]=== 
☐ Really short ( 0 - 2 hours)
☐ Short ( 2 - 8 hours)
☐ Few hours ( 8 - 12 hours)
☐ Long ( 12+ hours)
☑Endless

Two main modes, Career and Sandbox.  With career mode, you strive to manage the airport well, especially budget.  You can't spend too much unecessarily without the revenue or you'll go bankrupt.  Sandbox mode is fun.  Spend as much as you want!!!! Build as much as you want!!! Revenue?  Meh who cares in Sandbox mode.  Sandbox is also a great mode to learn more about how the game works (ie figuring out the baggage system).

The game is far from perfect and the designers are continously trying to improve the game. With what is currently available you can really design some really great airports.
It is difficult to understand how to play the game in the beginning without a tutorial but youtube searches helps with that as well as just trying things on your own in the open sandbox.
Once you got the hang of it I recommend you build from scratch and see how your airport develops over time. Im really happy with my design and add to it and remove things constantly. 

If you're a student, its a great game where you can design something great and then sit back and watch it run itself while you work on some assignment keeping it as a screensaver so to speak.

Being Early Access there are things that need work still to make the UI slightly more friendly search as dragging the screen around with the mouse and resolution and sizes of the different panels.
I like the idea of what they've started and can see what they're trying to do but it definitely needs work especially with the UI.
The biggest improvement that needs to be made is a tutorial as many people have said, as it was intially unclear as to what I had to do or how some of the structures work. If this is done it can be developed as they go on and improve and add more features.
Also think some of the baggage related graphics and movement needs to be more realistic. I had baggage moving through conveyors to the plane that I had put down to build but hadn't been built yet

Sim Airport is heavily influenced by the recent surge of builder sim games that have spawned off of Prison Arcitect and that is not a bad thing. I have many hours in Prison Arcitect and have put a few into this game as well. Because it is an early access game there are many problems with the current build, such as AI pathfinding is not perfect, systems yet to be implemented into the game, no tutorial (But I was able to figure it out fairly quickly), and general quality of life imporvements as well as optimization. That being my major complaint is optimization. Mid game 1000-2500 PAX/Passengers in your terminal have massive slowdowns that cause delayed and late flights as well as skipping and stopping of the game. Another issue is I find that making money can be too easy at least for me. In career mode I think selling fuel should not be an option as you can game the system pretty easily like a day trader. The cafe is interesting but needing 150 staff to handle 1000-2500 passengers seems excessive. As well as cashiers leaving their posts to handle kitchen duties that cause frustraited passengers that leave the line. Enable posts or duty positions in staff management may be a welcomed addition to prevent these problems. The introdution of a cafe into your airport can start causing massive delays so be strategic and centralized if possible. Constructing objects such as foundations mid game has large performance issues and slowdowns. Setting up a two lane road to the airport causes a bus/vehicle lane zagging match.
 
Even with all the negatives there are many positives.
Developers are active in formus and answering community questions as well as good communication as well as roadmap updates. 
I am very excited to revisit this game in a few months time to see what has changed. I enjoyed the hours I have put in and will enjoy putting in more hours. Into this game. 

Wishlist: 
*Optimization Imporvements Mid to late game is impossible for me GTX 970
*Cafe takes all business away from other retail operations rendering them useless needs fixed. 
* Kiosk Staff Management/Shifts.
*Upgraded Sprites on Passengers/Staff (I assume they are low quality for performance improvements right now.
*Disable selling fuel or change rate of fuel price change per day to not be too dramatic +-$1 to maybe +-$.20
* Better Road pathfining for vehicles and making it more airport like such as dropoff location upperlevel/pickuplocation lower level. Elevated parking solutions.
*Parking Garages another source of income
*Security threats (I need this badly) I need a danger in the airport security threats whether they be terrorist (Rare chance) or general threats such as guns, knives, bombs, liquids over 4oz, etc. I need something other than finances to manage to make the game more interesting. Basically a reason to use Body Scanners and randomized searches.
*Addition to above, security threats can be detained, arrested, searched. All having effect on passengers happiness if you are wrong or right. 
* Security threat cont: If a security threat gets through if causes issues later such as passenger happiness drop, airport security safetyness level lowered, airline happiness lowered, and can cause incidents which impact gameplay that can decimate finances as well as your reputation.
*Airport patrol security
*Airport trasnport staff (Help PAX/Passengers get to their gates)
*Package Airlines (A Fed-ex/USPS/UPS varient) Allows another source of income that is not PAX related. 
*Option to change cafe prices , or sell specific items with flow chart that shows popular items/most requested.
*Private Airlines (Vip Services, or general public planes such as Cessna and private charter flights(jets). 
*Emergency Incidents, Plance crash, Engine Out, Low Fuel, Broken Wing Etc. 
*Tarmac Staff, Plane Guides, Aircraft Tug Vehicles, Baggage Staff, Firecrews/Emergency Staff.
*Weather Conditions matter, E.g. Snow, which allows for having clearing crews that allow for flights not to be delayed.
*Airport Hotel Service for cancled flights to alleviate passanger dissatisfation for canceled flights. 

I guess I can go on forever but some of these would make the game alot more interesting for myself personally.
I do recommend this game currently but be warned about optimization issues with the current build in mid game.",1530806520,1530807731

For me, there's always been a dearth of good airport or airline (do that next, guys!) management sims out there - the few that there were prior to SA have not been very good.

Since I found SimAirport, it's been literally keeping me up at night - I can't stop playing. It takes that highly addictive approach that encourages you to do ""just one more thing"" before you can quit the game, because everything is so highly interdependent, and balance is key. Change one thing and it will have ripple effects throughout the airport, encouraging (or requiring) more changes as your airport grows.

The basic flow of the game is pretty standard at the moment - start with a small and money-losing airport and make it bigger and profitable. You can make money from flights you contract for and from passengers directly through retail, food and other in-game objects. There's no real goal - it's up to you if you just want the most money in cramped quarters at the expense of a few frustrated passengers, or if you want to make the most beautiful and efficient airport this side of PDX.

But there are a lot of objects available to make for a realistic airport, and like a real one, every in-game airport must be sectioned off into zones. There's a ticketing zone, a security zone, office zones, and many, many more. Each of these has specific object, construction and linking requirements that must be met to make them work, and many of them are interdependent to at least some extent (I've never tried outright deleting the ticketing zone, for example, but I don't imagine your airport would work at all without it). Other zones are optional, like the cafe zone, which satisfies your passengers' hunger but really isn't necessary if you have a small airport and just want to use food kiosks instead.

As you build your airport, hire the right people and research the right things, you'll unlock new objects that will allow you to attract larger airlines and larger planes. (The airlines are all fake, but the airplanes are real and range from the Dash 8 to the A380.) But you'd better be ready, because your airport can quickly become overrun with frustrated passengers who don't know where to go and can't make it to the gate in time. That can lead to canceled flights and reduced airline interest in your airport. Again, it's really about balance between what your airport can actually handle vs. the flights you schedule, and about reducing bottlenecks wherever they appear so you can grow further. So growth can either be a careful process of planning and execution, or a crazy mix of experimentation and iteration as you schedule your first A380 at your mid-size airport and then try to fix all the problems that come up. Different play styles are possible.

Every passenger has his or her own AI based on 10 or 12 attributes like hunger, comfort, environment, and others, as well as a departure flight that they know they need to make. So passengers make decisions based on all these things on an individual basis. In general it works really well at generating realistic traffic patterns within your airport, along with the kind of randomness you'd expect in real life too.

So the bones of a truly excellent game are all here. That said, there are some things that definitely need work.

First, the baggage conveyor system, which you'll want in a larger airport, is really confusing despite a recent revamp. It's partly due to a lack of instructions (I expect that in an early access game), but also due to weird design decisions like not being able to put two conveyor belts next to each other (and not mentioning that anywhere in-game!). Supposedly tutorials are coming this month, so maybe this will be partly alleviated with that update.

Second, the pax AI does still need some tuning, especially in how they deal with hunger. I can't for the life of me get my general hunger stat over 70%, and it actually went *down* when I installed a cafe because pax seem to prefer it to anything else and will go to the cafe even if they don't have time to eat there before their flight.

Third, I think it'd be good if there was at least some direction to what you're supposed to do. A ""career"" mode implies some scenarios that you work through as you build up your skills. Maybe give us different maps with different objectives and objects available to achieve them. At the end of the career, give us everything and a small airport to build up as we want. (Basically make the current ""career"" the final scenario, but with all research and objects unlocked from previous scenarios.)

The developers do have a roadmap and a lot of the ideas on it are good - stuff like keeping arrival and departure pax separated are necessary for realism of overseas flights and I can't wait for that. (I'd also love to see Customs being a requirement for accepting 747's and A380's, which isn't on the roadmap yet.) But it's still a really fun and addictive game as it is, as long as you understand that it's a little rough around the edges.",1530665730,1530665730

SimAirport is a very good and fun Airport simulation. The ""story"" of the game is rather short, but precise; You have to build a profitable Airport.

You can either build a passenger friendly, well designed and beautiful running airport, or you can try to create the Mos Eisley of Airports (or as i call it Manchester International Airport) with your goal to create a capacity machine with no luxury or ameneties.  Of course the passenger happiness has implications on how many flights airlines offer to your airport...but that can be adjusted by giving them a great deal and cheap fuel. Or you can go the other way around..or go for the golden middleground. The game offers many ways how to run your airport and an EXTREME amount of options on designing it. 

This is the mainpart of the game, the building part, and it is very well done and very enjoyable to watch your airport grow, manage expansion and remodelling, while keeping the operations running. And during all this, you can watch the passengers follow their trip from the bus to the plane...or vice versa and analzye their behavior, to improve your airport.

It also helps to find ways to squeeze them for money, without them knowing! #foodcourts/vending machines. 

Now this game is Early access, but its running very stable and playable. There are many features still to come and bugfixing or balancing going on but when a issue is voiced on the Steam forums the Devs are normally VERY quick to deliver a patch. It honestly feels not like an early access game at all. If you decide to play with the edge version, normally there are patches and features added several times a week. Also the devs are very active here on steam in the forums and you normally get helped fast.

So if youre looking a for a fun building and managing game which is airport themed, this one is for you.

In SimAirport you can either build your own airport from scratch or start of with the basics already done for you -- you then need to manage passenger needs, keep airlines happy and work on improving your airport to handle more pax and more flights. 

There are no random events or any element of surprise once you're set up at a particular stage, you can keep the game running and come back to find yourself loaded with money without any consequences. That is the only drawback this game currently has, but I see potential in random security threats and other random events in the future, and have faith having seen the developers love and dedication towards the game.",1529390238,1529390238

The game has definitely a lot to improve, but it's fully playable. I only see minor bugs like stuck passengers, or stuck workmen next to escalator. Nothing is a deal breaker. 

Now, I dont usually write a review, but here are my thoughts:
1. We really really really need an in-game tutorial. Nothing fancy, just some text and pictures. It took me a while to figure out how the conveyor system works, how the passenger AI works, how the security works, and the flow of the passengers.
2. It takes a while to build (or demolish) everything because it has to be done by workmen. The sandbox mode gives you unlimited fund but there is no instant building mode. I spent too much time waiting and planning. The devs give planning tools but it's less fun to lay out plan than to directly plan-as-you-build like The Sims / Cities Skylines. 
3. In Prison Architect, we can copy all layout and stuffs to ease building. It would be nice to see this feature in SimAirport.
4. More workshop and mods would be nice. 

Some of the good points of this game:
1. Details oriented.
2. The devs actually listen and improve the game a lot.
3. New features keep coming in.

I travel through airports a lot across the world, so the game is becoming more real-life, and I guess I have started to adapt my games to how I'd like to go through an airport.  

Performance continues to be an issue (so far) but with each release it gets better, and the earlier games where the game was un-playable is no longer the case.

The interaction with the development team, and their involvement in the Forums is excellent, with them personally embedded into the game.

My advice if you're thinking of this game..? Give it a go.",1529257983,1529257983

I would like to be able to react to threats such as fire or crime.
Id love to have a system wich allows me to control for smuggle contraband.

Even bigger Maps would be great with Monorail kinda transportation.

One could think of buying parking decks to get some more income.

2) Research takes way too long. I'd like to see the time to completion cut down so that I can eventually see what all of the tools do.

The game looks promising, but I wonder what's in the future of it and what the end goal is. 

In it's current state it feels like an ""incrementer"" game: You build up a solid economy, wait for money to build up or take as many loans as you can pay interest for, build an expansion for your airport, then wait again so you eventually repay loans or make so much money that the loans don't matter. 

It's a game that runs itself, and that's its biggest issue. If your only part of the game is building the airport while management becomes increasingly automatic, the problem becomes that the player loses agency.

I really hope to see more of the following in the future:
- Management of staff
- Management of security issues
- Problems with diseases or passengers having health problems (crisis response team etc...)
- Security threats (yes, terrorist attacks are included in that)
- Random custom made characters that will show up (Elvis, Michael Jackson, a ninja, Sherlock Holmes...)
- Inspections for better (or worse) ratings
- Incoming and outgoing traffic management (parking, garages, public transport)
- News announcements that concern the airport
- More precise statistics on passenger moods

Otherwise, its been a fun 20 hours. Or at least the first 12 were fun, but then the economy snowballed and then it stopped being fun. Hence the ""incrementer"" part.

You can safely buy this game, but you should be fully aware that this game is far from complete and has a bit to go yet. You will get 10-20 hours of something to do, then it ends. It is fun to begin with if you want a management game, but it lacks debth. But that is the issue with all Early Access games I guess.

Simulations are a tricky thing to make, and in making SimAirport, LVGameDev clearly decided to go for the gold. Extremely high degrees of customizability and complexity on an already detailed foundation is a recipe for either absolute greatness or complete disaster. Now, as an early access title, it's unfair to expect perfection; it's a work in progress. Granted, some issues exist and others arise through playtestings (which is what a proper EA period is anyway). However, the strides the developers have made - even since a review written only two weeks prior to this version - are nothing short of astounding, and the attention paid to the community's reports, suggestions, and questions is something all developers would do well to learn from. So, point by point, here's a look at the current state of SimAirport, as of April 20, 2018.

Allow me to point out that as a largely offline gamer, my Steam play clock isn't even close to accurate.

As a simulation, much of the task during play is to build systems and arrangements that work effectively, efficiently, and profitably. Most simulations focus on aspects of the task at hand, giving players a highly edited macro-level view of the proceedings and essentially sweeping most of the details under the rug, promising that they're part of the simulation model...somewhere. Consequently, it's extremely refreshing to see a sim that puts everything right out in the open and on your to-do list. To say that SimAirport is ambitious is a grave understatement. This is a simulation game that most don't even try to be, offering an incredible range of customization and play options, while requiring players maintain touch with both the macro- and micro-level view. And the level of detail employed is breathtaking. You must tend not only to the operational needs of an airport - deciding layouts of runways, taxiways, gates, and support systems - but also the needs of a very busy service location as your passengers are human beings that require a LOT of looking after, herding, and (since this *is* a business sim) some fleecing. Hey, you have to make money to keep the lights on.

The art style isn't photorealistic, but this counts as a definite positive, as the simpler but still detailed graphics enable this simulation to run well even on fairly low-level machines until you've built a truly massive airport. (It's also worth noting that its style aims for realism rather than the comparative cartoonishness of similar titles like Another Brick in the Mall.) Graphical customizability is extremely high and allows players to indulge their builder-game tastes. (Airport with hardwood floors? Go fot it.) Audio is outstanding, and I strongly suspect some LiveATC audio was used to give SimAirport authentic radio chatter from the tower. Sound effects - even jet noise, which generally sounds flat and dull in games - are rich and immersive. And the attention to detail paid by the developers deserves its own mention; nearly everything is as close to reality as is practical. Runway lighting and marking standards, precision approach hardware, taxiway conventions - they're all textbook perfect. (Aviation fans, rejoice!) 

When you go for this level of complexity in a multi-level simulation game, you're in for a lot of work...and rework. Until a game is completely nailed together, sanded, and polished, you're going to pick up the occasional splinter. However, given that this is an EA title, it's amazing how few of those there are - and how short a lifespan they have once detected. In my prior review, I'd mentioned several major bugs, particularly a traffic breakdown which essentially took the game with it. Well...they're all gone. In the span of two weeks, the developers acted on community feedback and bug reports and those bugs were quickly and soundly squashed. 

That's not to say this is a perfect game, and there are a few types of players who won't enjoy the game at this stage of development. Currently, the largest shortcoming is a lack of documentation - no tutorial or help file exists yet, although they are currently under development. As a result, some of the less-intuitive processes and systems (baggage leaps to mind) are a good deal of trial-and-error. While the documentation is under development, though, the fan community is highly active on the forums and tends to answer questions swiftly, so odds are that a first-time player who gets lost will probably find the answer already on the forum - and, if not, will get help pretty quickly. Some balancing still needs tweaking, although this, too, is actively being worked on. (And is one of the most notoriously difficult parts of developing a complex sim; tweaking one item can break a bunch of others, so it has to be done carefully. It's a mark in the developers' favor that not once in my experience has a tweak of theirs actually broken the game. That shows a lot of forethought and care.)  In short, the few problems that do exist are both minor and the subject of intense effort.

The developers are making incredible progress in improving, expanding, and refining this game, and I firmly believe that a substantial reason for their ongoing success in that effort is their engagement with the game's community. Where most developers offer lip-service to the ""we listen to our gamers!"" mantra, these folks actually follow through. They're active on the forum and constantly - *constantly* - looking to make the game better. They deliberately ask ""what isn't right about our game?"" and want honest answers. They solicit and *listen* to suggestions for improvements and expansions - all of them. True, sometimes the answer is no, but even then they explain their reasoning. It's a level of developer care and interest I don't think I've ever seen. 

So, yes, this is still a game wending its way through development, so as new features are added the occasional odd bug makes itself known. It's not perfect yet, but the developers are making a concerted effort to get it there. And I've played recent full-release AAA titles that don't have half of the level of care and skill that SimAirport has as an Early Access title. (Looking at you, EA Games - pay attention: this developer knows what it's doing. Watch, learn, emulate.) 

At the end of the day, net-net, SimAirport is an outstanding title and the kind of game I always hope to find. Complex games are something I enjoy, and there are so few that try to operate at this level. If you like complicated simulations and having the power to affect every single aspect of its scope, then SimAirport is an outstanding choice. There are, as I said, small issues that pop up every now and again, and the current state of documentation is unfortunate, but most sim gamers should find this an extremely enjoyable title. Personally, I'm extremely glad I found this game.",1522987809,1524279543

Around the same time last year I left a scathing review (copied below for posterity) complaining primarily about balance. I have to say, the developers have done a TREMENDOUS job with bug fixes and enhancements in the last year.

Your starting finances (which are now actually less than the $1.5MM mentioned below) and the basic 1 gate airport the game starts with is a great starting point, with just enough money and resources to get you building and make you profitable.

Now I never feel like I'm truly underwater, even if I dip into the red a bit. Some tweaks to flights or concessions got me profitable again, and a delicately balancing income with the occasional loan allows you to grow your airport quickly (but not too quickly) and have a lot of fun in the process.

I also complained in my previous review about estimated income not reflecting what actually happened each in-game day. I would say it's still a bit off, but the additional finance information (esp. after hiring a CFO) helps explain and fix any discrepancies.

Overall, this game has improved hugely in the last year and I would be very happy to recommend it to anyone who enjoys simulators. I find sims fall into one of two categories; either management or creativity. Somehow SimAirport is able to challenge both your management skills and creativity at the same time.

Thank-you for making my evenings just a little bit brighter.

ORIGINAL REVIEW

I love sims and really wanted to love SimAirport. Unfortunately it's just not there yet. My biggest complaint is BALANCE. And unfortunately, not matter how great your game mechanics are (which they really are fantastic and have a lot of potential here) the game sucks if there's no balance. Time is too long. Even at 10x speeds you'll be sitting there bored for multiple minutes while your foundation is built. Money isn't balanced at all. In easy sandbox mode you start with $1.5 million, which isn't even enough to build a runway, taxiway, gate, and foundation. Not to mention seating, security, queues, ticket booths etc.

This could be a good game with better timing and money balance, but until then I cannot recommend it.

Edit: even in career mode the finances are whack. My finance board says my estimated profit per day is around $56,000 however I consistently lose $5,000 per day. Now I understand ""estimate"" and things like weather and pax can affect profits, but by the estimate being off by over $60,000 per day? No, that doesn't work.",1521327307,1551290753

Lots of this game is infrastructure and foot traffic management, as well as the obvious flight management.

I am not good with words so I can't say much more, but I can fully recommend this game if you like the rollercoaster tycoon/sim city/prison architect style of games, and even if you don't but like flying, this game is great.

I look forward to further updates! They come pretty regularly, major updates every so often but smaller updates and hotfixes several times per week!

SimAirport is a management simulation where the player runs an airport at a generic location. Unless the player chooses to go with a pre-made airport, the player builds an airport from sctratch (with extra money to compensate), takes on contracts to accept planes to and from nondescript locations, and money is earned through gate and runway usage fees.  More money can be earned through the placement of vending machines, retail kiosks, and refueling operations. From there, the player will want to expand their airport to include refueling (if they did not build refueling equipment and faciities at the start), lengthen the runway(s), and either add more gates, or add larger gates to facilitate larger aircraft to get more passengers and higher usage fees from the airlines at the expense of having to redesign check-in, departure seating, and the security zone(s).

[H1]GRAPHICS AND SOUND[/H1]

The graphics to SimAirport are simplistic, yet aren't ugly in any way.  You can expect the occasional bleed-through, and some really odd movement from passengers and flight crew in and out of the terminal. If such movement agitates you, there's always the ability to zoom out.  When you research the ability to build two-lane roads, you can expect some very odd movements by vehicles who change lanes for no reason.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1323436788

The sound in SimAirport is flawless; it sounds just like being at an airport.  There's the roar of jet engines taking off, dings from the PA system making announcements, crowd chatter, and the sound tools from construction workers when they're assigned to build or maintain objects and structures around the airport.

[H1]POSITIVES[/H1]

My personal favorite feature in SimAirport, is the ability to designate queues to be used by any combination of coach passengers, first class passengers, or flight crews for check-in desks, I.D. stands, departure desks, and cafe cash registers.  Queues can be set to exclusive use, which makes it easier to manage all of the peons who fly in coach.  The queues also have signs color coded for class usage, so you don't have to go out of your way to double check if a particular person can or cannot use a queue.

Buying and selling fuel is an important part of money making, and the game gives you good information at your disposal concerning fuel services.  I always go rushing to this screen when prices are to my liking, but I appreciate being able to know the average price I've paid for fuel and the demand for fuel from the day before.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1320468363

SimAirport doesn't make players guess at how long a runway needs to be.  If you're not laying a long enough of a runway to land any sort of aircraft, the game prevents you from doing so.  If you can at least land the smallest sorts of aircraft on a runway, the game gives you a list of all the types.  The longer you lay your runway, the more types of aircraft appear on the list.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1301549655

Runways can also be easily lengthened, instead of having to tear up an entire runway, and build a whole new runway.

[H1]NEGATIVES[/H1]

Passengers and flight crew exhibit the sort of behavior a player can expect from a game in early access, and perhaps that is the reason why SimAirport has been in early access for nearly a year at the time of this writing.  The only way I could ever get first class passengers inside of first class lounges, was to put in a departure desk and a phone charger. Sometimes a first class passenger would even sit down.  Even more rare is that I've seen flight crew members use flight crew lounges.  I'm lucky to have even seen two flight crew members actually sit down inside of their respective lounge, but I'm lucky just to see them even go inside of a lounge, never mind the fact it's got nice seats, as well as high ratings for flight information, announcements, and environment.  First class passengers and flight crews don't seem to even care that they have exclusive restrooms, and seem to be just fine using toilets and hanging around with the rest of the peons in the airport.  (Note:  PAX AI was deleted since it has been improved, and PAX will now take the shortest routes to complete tasks.)

The system for determining frequencies of buses, light rail, trash pickup, and cafe food delivery is way too simplistic. After building a light rail station, naturally, my focus on passenger movement to and from the airport changed, and while it was normally prudent to have the light rail arrive every two hours (and change buses to once every hour), there were several times I would have prefered to have the light rail more times at a certain time of day and of course, it's unfair for the player to have light rail and buses arriving at the airport when there's no passengers to drop off and pick up, because the player has to pay usage fees, even when there's no incoming and no outgoing users at a certain time of day.

SimAirport features Boeing 707's?!  No airline based in a civilized nation has used them since the Reagan administration.  (An Iranian carrier removed their last 707 from service in 2013...  But I don't think many people consider Iranians to be ""civilized...""  Or at least I certainly hope not!!)

The absolute biggest complaint about SimAirport, would have to be the lack of an in-game tutorial. When I first built an airport from scratch, I couldn't figure out why my gate was flagged for being insecure.  I only figured it out when I decided to look at the premade terminal that I realized that outside portions of the airported needed to be surrounded by either a fence or wall.  Nearly two hundred days in game, I noticed that planes were getting held up by baggage loading.  The game should have educated the player of how two baggage cars can service the same plane, and I once sold my fuel truck for no reason, except that I personally didn't believe it would be needed after I built a fuel port at an aircraft gate.

[H1]CONCLUSION[/H1]

Do you love airplanes?  You should be ashamed of yourself for not owning this game!  Do you love management sims?  You'll love this one no matter what you think of airports or airplanes.  Are you in the witness protection program, or are just looking to avoid contact with the outside world?  Then get this game; it will keep you well occupied, and far away from human contact. Only I cannot recommend SimAirport at anything higher than it's ""on sale"" price until the AI gets fixed and several other kinks get worked out.  If you get this game, you better plan on going to the forums to see how to connect check-in desks, baggage depots, and baggage carousels to baggage hubs, and you also better plan on looking up many more ""how to's,"" but thankfully, enough people have asked questions about what they're doing wrong on Steam's general discussions page to SimAirport that chances are, the problem you're having, has already been mentioned and someone else has posted a solution.  Despite being a ""mostly finished"" project, SimAirport is still an amazing game that will take over other games you love if SimAirport fits your niche...  It may even take over your life.

[i]SimAirport[/i] has been nominated for the Steam 2018 “'Labor of Love' Award"" for the amount of effort the developer is continuing to put into the game well after release.

You can run a decent sized airport with check-in, ticketing, security, restaurants, toilets etc etc.

However, once your airport is big enough to have the large 240 tile runway, when the heavys start to land it lags badly.

Clearly much optimisation to be done. My only concern is that the DEV's are apparently working hard on the additional floors for the terminals and such, but why not optimise first?

There are currently major unresolved memory leak issues in this prerelease  (reported since Apr 2017) and will likely lead to only very short playtimes of an hour or so before needing to quit, go have coffee for a half hour (to let Windows cool down and regain its sanity) then start the game again only to have the issue crop up again in another hour or so.  Systems with more RAM will go a bit longer depending on how much extra memory is available but it's been reported even on systems of 20GB or so after two hours of play. TURN ON AUTOSAVE.  You have been warned.

*** End of disclaimer ***

With that out of the way the game itself is a quite detailed simulation of airport management with plenty of room to experiment with taxiway layouts, passenger services, runway and gate sizes, tightness of flight schedules, financing, etc.  Research will be required to unlock additional airport features [spoiler]such as PA systems, fuel systems and rail access to the airport[/spoiler].

A great way to spend HOURS trying to get an airport that can finally make something other than red ink day-to-day and pay off the initial capital expenditure used to construct it.

As far as play goes construction is a bit unforgiving if you mess up a location of something it immediately charges with no option to undo the placement immediately, though it may be cancelled the money is still gone (it's obviously not yet built so no reason for this other than to frustrate players at the user interface level - if you are within a second or two of placing something on wrong square and no worker has yet touched it should have a CTRL-Z option to either cancel or provide a move/rerotate option).  Another annoyance is walls on foundation sections.  L shapes cannot be constructed in a manner that won't create inside walls that need to be cleared away (L and T layouts are very common in airports due to architecturing them to have a pinch point (screening) between the two security zones).

Overview: This game is a must if you like games such as Prison Architect, Cities Skylines etc. It follows a similar approach to building the ultimate airport. If you like those games you will enjoy this game. I currently have 63 hours on record!

The Good: The development is great; the game is evolving and I think this game has a good future ahead. The developers are very active in the community and this can only be a good thing. The community is very active in general. You can subscribe to the “Edge” branch and receive regular but unstable updates.

The Bad: Development has a long way to go, although this game is very enjoyable (and playable) in the current state, there are many bugs to be ironed out. The developers are clearly working hard to iron these out daily.

Verdict: 9/10. If you like any of the aforementioned games, buy this you will not regret it!

Economically, like most games, once you get over a ""hump"" money becomes a lot easier. However, the constant big daily purchases you need to make (Oil for more attractive airlines) does add a nice constraint.

Building the airports are the most fun for me. The planning tools are very helpful and the newly added instant build in sandbox mode makes it easier to build large airports in a shorter amount of time.

A lot of people complained about bugs in their reviews. Sure, nothing is perfect and creating something like this is very challenging with all the different types of players and platforms. In my experience throughout this time, this game has never been unplayable for me.

I can agree with some of you when it comes to the end game. You can set up an airport and progress rather quickly. Once your airport is humming, you can sit back and rake in the cash with little effort. There is a random even feature now and this adds a little excitement to the game at all stages. It never gets boring for me because there is always something to change, add on or download from the workshop.

I am very grateful for the dedication and involvement of the dev team. They are on many social platforms and are quick to answer question, concerns or to help with any issues you have. The community has grown well in my opinion and everyone seems willing to help out their fellow gamer at any time.

I am still looking forward to what this game brings us in the future.

----Jan 2018 review----

Reviewing an early release game is like reviewing a sandwich before you taste it.
However, the way it is made and the presentation are very important too!

I was addicted to this game from day 1. It's just fun in a lot of different ways. The planning and construction tools make it easy to turn your dreams into reality. Well, simulated reality.  Does it have bugs? Depends on your definition. Does everything work perfectly the first time? No, but if you post an issue in the forum, it is fixed in the next cycle. Not weeks or months later.

I have played SimAirpot for more than 500 hours and there has never been a bug or a problem that made this game unplayable. The development team may be small, but they act professional and produce big results.

I am happy to have made this purchase and i can't wait to see what these guys come up with next.
Thank you for all your hard work. I know i appreciate it ;)",1516060663,1586176531

[b]Disclaimer[/b]
As someone traveling a lot for business I have seen my fair share of airports.
This, and my love towards managing games, let me believe I can create the perfect airport easily. Well it turned out it need some tries.

[b]Overview[/b]
You will have different options to start your venture, either by starting from scratch (with more funds) or with a small pre-made airport.

There will be plenty of stuff you can plan with and has different effects on efficiency and passenger satisfaction.

Most of the time you will spend thinking how to make everything faster and bigger but this evolution is the key motivation I think.

[b]Rating[/b]
9/10 for regular Gamers
10/10 for actual Airport planners since they could try here first :)

[b]The highlights[/b]
[list]
[*] Many different objects
[*] Airline ecosystem to unlock new Airlines
[*] Good variation of Aircrafts
[*] You can spend a lot of time in this game
[*] Frequent updates, you can subscribe to Edge-branch if you cannot wait
[/list]

[b]The lowlights[/b]
[list]
[*] There are some weird passenger behaviour and sometimes performance-issues, the developers are frequently addressing. (is an Early Access title nonetheless)
[*] Not all features implemented yet (is an Early Access title nonetheless)
[/list]

[b]Multiplayer[/b]
No! (EarlyAccess)

[b]Mods[/b]
+Yes!
Via Workshop you can one-click install mods like new airlines and other stuff like Airport-saves

[b]Microtransactions/DLC[/b]
No! (EarlyAccess)

[b]Summary[/b]
Should you already like other similar games then you will like this one as well, I mean who does not like Airplanes, at least those not being afraid of it.

It is really challenging and gives you a lot to tinker around to create the perfect airport, should you ever get there.

Seeing myself how the Edge-branch is developing it is a joy to see how the game comes along, the developers found a good way of improving as well as introducing new content so far.

But, when I played, I had 2 big problems that, unfortunately, made me ask for refund:
1 - The game has a few bugs and problems of gameplay. I think that, with some time, this can be easily fixed, and the upcomming tutorial will help the players to understand all the stuff in it.
2 - The game crashes my PC every 20 minutes: I'm playing the game, and it starts to bug the screen, the keyboard and the mouse stop working and I have to restart Windows. It only happens with THIS GAME, I played Overwatch, Minecraft, Legue of Legends and many other games and it just happens in SimAirport.

I reallly wish that the developers can fix it, and this game became a success. It's an amazing game, with an amazing future, but NOW I'm sorry but, at least for me, this game is not playable at all. But I swear that, in the future, when this appears to be fixed and working pretty well, I will rebuy it.

Why: While in Early Access, I can not recommend that anyone spend their money on this game. At least not just yet. The controls are still sloppy, the game is still glitchy, and there is no functioning tutorial. This leaves the player hunting for 1). player made tutorials by those who started out confused (like you) and got  pissed  off (like you will) and took the time to figure everything out and then record what they did to help others...or 2). player made airports which have things functioning so that you can see how things are set up and try to expand from there.

Player made tutorials are not a bad thing - but a game with no fuctioning instructions at this time is upsetting.

There are a lot of really interesting airport layout ideas that work well, and as a manager-style game, you can't ask for more.  ""Rimworld or Prison Architect for airports"" really is accurate.  The sound and weather are solid and interesting, the ambient sound is great as you zoom in to hear specific zones.  The aircraft selection is fairly realistic and spans a few generations of airframes.  The choice of airlines served adds depth with their different priorities, fleet size, demands, and refueling chances.  The sprites used for all the objects especially seems to have gotten a great deal of care, with gate parking markings for different airframes' nosewheel indicators.

Sadly the bugs really break this as a game, so far.  If you know Early Access and are okay with that, this is a real gem.  But nearly all games are prematurely ended by a save-breaking bug that stops your airport dead in some fashion or another.  Bus blocks the entire road, no more deliveries or passengers or fuel.  Baggage truck bucks out on the tarmac, now that vehicle and it's parent hangar are immovable and can't be erased or destroyed, locking that parcel of land forever.  There are also bugs that set you back a long way without outright ruining your save, such as crew members not loading (causing a plane that won't load any of the 500+ passengers waiting at the gate), taxiway gridlock where aircraft can't decide where to go, and passengers and crew being randomly stuck in invisible tiny prisons, causing your airport reputation to suffer.

It's a neat little game, unfortunately it's pretty badly optimized at the moment, making it more and more frustrating as the airport grows.
_________________________________________________________________

Now that the game is ""cleared to land"" I decided to give it another go.

This game is not worth 20 bucks, but it is worth a buy on sale... Here's why:

- Optimization issues still stand, although I can now relatively comfortably have a 10k pax/day airport anything above that is a nightmare. I swear the AI shares a finite amount of brain cells, and once you've reached a certain amount of pax all logic flies out the window alongside your keyboard. IMO it makes the game unplayable in sandbox mode.

-Also as the airport grows I've noticed it literally eats up my CPU capacity, forcing me to relaunch the save every so often to fix random bugs/glitches. 

-Content has been added etc etc, you'll run out of vanilla things to do eventually, but probably not before your pax spontaneously combust. Obviously the workshop has been added since my original review, but I never got around to playing with the mods due to the god aweful optimization. 

If you're intending to build the airports represented in the trailer, get ready for a slugish, dreadful, yet somewhat enjoyable game.",1511558620,1587331900

All of the information one needs is displayed in an easy to understand, well laid out way. I found it quite an enjoyable and rewarding experience mastering the game on my own, though I could image some would like a tutorial (I'm sure one will be added). There is a default, very basic starter airport for Sandbox mode which is nice to learn the game mechanics on before diving in. However, as stated above, the average player will certainly lose their first few games.[/td]

SimAirport is one that will have you double-taking at the clock wondering how you managed not to notice it was 4 A.M. The gameplay doesn't feel stale, even in the end game, because there is always something you can build or expand, and there is always something the can be made more efficient. [/td]

This is a very promising game but still has a way to go. The core mechanics are in place but at present there is not yet enough depth or challenge to give this game long term playability. It's a challenge to get a profitable airport initially but once there (and once you learn the game) it's straight forward and the airport is pretty much self sustaining with no challenge left.

There are lots of great sounding ideas planned that could make this a great game - such as First Class meaning something, random events beyond weather blips, etc - but at the moment don't expect a challenging management game. For now this is more like a sandbox game where you can make a big airport and watch it run.

It's worth buying right now IF you're willing to watch the game grow and/or if you want to contribute to the community (including of course supporting the game by buying it!); and this is regularly evolving and being updated by the devs which is great. I've enjoyed the 10 hours I've plugged into the game so far and am glad I bought it. But as with any Early Access, if you're expecting a fully fledged game then you may be disappointed at this stage (Nov 2017).

I'm at a point in the game where in order to expand I need to have an additional runway. This whole game I've been very conservative. I've only hired what I needed. No addt'l workers. I have only 5 stands (2 small, 3 large). Take home ~36k/day. I have to expand to make more money per day, Either I focus on building more inside or stands or building more outside. I've already built all the retail I can. I have a cafe. Tons of news stands, several ATMs. I can't squeeze any more seating, plants or anything else for that matter with the space I have. If I build more stands my rating goes down because I have only 1 runway and I can't add any more to it without constantly causing delays. People get pissed. I lose contracts. So then building a new run way it is. Okay, so a runway is 100k, plus I need lights because my contracts have night flights. So, 25k more. Now I need to get to that run way. Lets see, a taxiway block is 18k per square. I need minimum 9 for the size of the runway and 2 more to connect. So 198k. Alright. Now I need to get to that runway from my current structure. That's at least 4 more taxiway blocks, plus I'll need a turnaround to keep things going. So, lets say 4 more. 144k. So 125k for runway and lights. 342k in taxiway (<-- this seems super unbalanced). So just to get a new runway plus taxiway I need ~$467k. I make 36k a day. It would take about 13 days to get there. I mean if that's what it takes, that's what it takes. I guess I could fire staff to reduce my hourly. But they do stuff now and if I fire them, I risk losing customer satisfaction. I also could focus on fuel delivery, but that opens a whole other can of worms with research, the money and time involved there. Plus the facilities and assets required. I would rather not feel like I have to put the game at full speed and walk away just to make progress due to my perceived monetary restrictions.

From that perspective, the game doesn't suck me in. I've otherwise had a ton a fun playing. The building and staff mechanics remind me a lot of Prison Architect, another favorite of mine.

Future Recommendations: 

-What about creating more zones like an executive center, first class dining or first class seating areas? 

-Not sure how this would even work, but 2 floors would be cool. Look at software inc. They did multiple stories well IMO.

-Allow for multiple drop off and pick up areas. Having only one in a large airport just doesn't seem right. Passengers should be able to be dropped off at the ticketing center closest to their drop off zone. Maybe this can be a feature that comes with advanced ticketing? 

-Build-in mechanics to support construction zones to prevent non-secure areas and freaked out passengers. I get the process of requiring all passengers to go through security if something becomes non-secure. But that leaves at minimum only 2 hours to build without passengers. If you have a full schedule, passengers start arriving at 1:45 AM and last flight is around 10-11pm depending on delays. In order to build foundation (which you guessed it, is also super expensive) you can only do a little at time because of a) monetary restrictions and b) you otherwise risk creating a non-secure environment for passengers, c) the # workers you have and where you build in conjunction to delivery zone depends how fast things build 2 only 2 hours. Even behind the fence when you're constructing they freak out (get stuck) if there's an open wall to the outside. Maybe make it so that as part of the game you have to create construction zones ahead of building, so passengers don't freak out and wouldn't have to empty the whole airport mid-day for a full security check (yea, that happens, and it sucks). In real life there's construction going on at an airport at any given time and passengers aren't affected, generally. Construction zones would force proper planning and restrict passengers from entering, IMHO.",1509155340,1509155340

...the only reason I am not giving it a thumbs down.


SimAirport is promising, but as of 20171017 it is nothing but a shell of a game. You can do exactly what is required to get passangers to and from an airplane. That is it!

However it does take about 10-20 hours to discover this, so if you think the current price is worth 10-20 hours and you want to support the devs for this genre - go for it!

Devs:
1: Get some events in there asap... (from small things that adds a minute or two to a boarding, or force a re-allocation of gates, to an airline-company going bankrupt) Without this, you do not have a game...
2: Why do you even have a small/medium airfields? Skipping to Large, makes the other two fields redundant. Much wider price-ranges needed. Large AF could easily be placed at 10 million, if not more... 

This game is a really rough gem - which I did enjoy, but see no point in playing any more. (~20h effective gametime, where the first 2 was spent figuring the game out.)",1508246137,1508246506

So far it is turning out to be a good game, and I do recommend purchasing and supporting in this early EA phase as the game has enough to offer already and should only go up from there. If you are a fan of Prison Architect as I am, you will see a very similar play-style and will not be dissapointed.


- Pros and Cons as of EA -

Pros 

   - EA Playability - 
      I am a heavy critic of games, and especially EA games as a victim of many hypetrains in the past. I am happy to say right out of the gate (pun intended) this game is entertaining and has provided me with hours of game play in it's current state, I don't feel my money was gambled away as I would have been satisfied with it's current state and don't have to use the dreaded words ""has potential"" in a review. It's a good game, and getting better as opposed to a broken mess and -could- get better.

  - Replayability - 
      I'm often rebuilding an airport trying to find the best configuration, I can already see this game as something I will come back to over and over.

  - Difficulty - 
     I can't stand hand-holding or games that are impossible to lose. This one allows you to easily lose via unrecoverable bankruptcy. Not sure if that is an intended design, but I do hope harsh failure conditions remain till the end stage. This game provides a challenge with each step of your airport design, and each expansion of it poses risks to the whole.


Cons

    - Artwork - 

        Whoever designed the artwork, while decent, looks like they learned how to do graphic design in the 90s. Scaling your window blurs the different icon images in the toolbar as if the graphic designer had absolutely no concept of vector images and made everything in MS paint and put them in the game as an unscalable gif image. That coupled with the horrendous, poorly textured lime green grass make this game atrocious to look at at times. Seriously devs, as a graphic designer, I would happily step in and spend the whopping 1 day it would take to fix this, send me a message.

    - Crashes -
   
      While -very- rare, I have experienced a few bugs where the game will crash or hang when expanding the land area via purchasing. Make sure to save before you do!


Overall, I do enjoy this game and would recommend it to anyone looking in on it. I am very anti-EA and found this to be one of the few worth supporting.",1507908696,1507908696

The baggage system:  As it stands, the tracks cannot intersect, so it becames a logic game to try to set everything up. It is horribly frustrating. This is BY FAR the worst part of the game. It needs to be greatly simplified. An easy fix would be to have the ability to intersect.

The foundation takes forever to build. There should be an auto-foundation feature. 

My wish list (revised since the developers implemented some of my suggestions):
-A customs zone/international terminal.
-Airport police and fire.
-Ability to build elevated and multi-tier roadways so that check in can be on floor 2 and bag claim on floor G.
-Massive simplification of baggage system.

Here are some helpful things to be aware of starting the game
-Be very careful about adding new gates, EVERYTHING else will need a capacity upgrade afterward.
-Passengers will miss flights if ticketing, or security, cannot handle the volume
-Be prepared to have to remodel everything in your airport as it grows and you find yourself needing larger/more efficient service areas
-Fully schedule every gate for best income/traffic volume
-Keep an eye on all operations from garbage collection to the gates
-Occasionally a plane will wait for 1-4 passengers to fill it, use the force departure option before it causes another flight to get cancelled(cancelled flights will cost you $1k's in lost revenue)
-Wait until you have the money and research need to hire executives.  The up-front expense is a bit pricey, and their wages will make a very noticable cut in you airport's income.  I would also suggest firing them once the techs have been researched.",1507459248,1507459248

If you're a Prison Architect junkie, you WILL like this game.


EDIT:

Wooooo boy they completely wrecked this game. Lets start with the obvious. The graphics seem to have taken a turn for the worse. The game used to have a simple, evocative color pallet, but now it seems as if they're going for some weird uncanny valley area art and textures that really don't look right at all. At it's heart this is a pawn management game, make them look like your standard pawns (e.g. Rimworld, Prison Architect, etc.). We DO NOT need this creepy ass looking models they have now that look like animated mannequins tap dancing on the gate desks (and walking on the seat of a moving vehicle they're trying to drive)

Construction moves at a glacial pace now as well, and the game makes it impossible early on to determine the amount of manpower needed to accomplish tasks, and none of this is helped by a UI that has not substantially evolved in ways that are user friendly. 

I originally played this game and easily reached that equilibrium point where I was at efficient scale without breaking a sweat. Ideally there would be another level of complexity to challenge the player in a rational way. This game skips making things incremental and drops a byzantine level of complexity on the player the moment they start the game. 

I can no longer recommend this game, which is a shame. But hopefully that will change in the future.",1507267385,1571848813

The developers are really responsive and make this a solid experience.

---

SimAirport has come a very long way this year - I now consider it a very good purchase and would rate it 7.5/10 already.

What is it? Superficially similar to the newly released Airport CEO, it focuses on providing infrastructure and services for both airlines and passengers. You will have to create an airport that is able to efficiently route passengers to their gates, whilst feeding them and keeping them comfortable along the way. Certain airlines also have preferences and demands that have to be met in order to attract their flights (and not having them reneged). Building-wise, expansions are very costly, which requires you to manage space quite efficiently. You have to take traffic load into account (more gates = more space in schedule = more flights = more runway movements = congestion, if not counteracted) and provide just enough capacity for check-in, baggage, security, restrooms and entertainment/food services to passengers. Aircraft may request refueling, too. 
The graphics style is of course something you can choose to like or dislike. In some ways it is similar to Prison Architect - and that is felt all the way into some GUI elements. I personally love PA, so I am fine with that.

SimAirport now is a quite stable simulation with less and less flaws. 
Here are my top pros and cons:
+ Entertaining simulation with just the right degree of abstraction
+ high degree of transparency
+ custom airlines add flavor
+ credible airport structures
+ LOVE the management aspect of the game that rewards intelligent structures and logistics (=passenger) flows
+ Super responsive dev team that churns out updates almost daily, if you are on the EDGE beta branch

- plane pathfinding is still less than sterling
- some balancing issues persist - i.e. taxiways are more expensive than runways
- some prioritisation issues with passengers

Maybe there should have been two floors so that we can distinguish between arrival and departure it looks incredibly stupid everyone interferes with the security zone. 
The runway can not handle many flights at the same time, when the flight crew does not know where to drive, perhaps we should also have two runways and choose manually who lands and takes off then there will be more structure in the schedule and less confused captains. and the lag has to be improved.

Pros: 
* You can build your own airport (security area, bathrooms, food courts, gates, queues), customize flight schedules, hire and fire staff (janitors, security, gate and checkin staff, maintenance/builders)
* You can use or build your own custom airlines

Cons:
* After around 8-10 gates on a map the game tends to slow down a lot, even if those gates are not active or there's no ""pax"" in your airport
* The speed at which a pax walks in the game is not realistic, taking around 1-2 hours of in game time to get from one end of the airport to the other. There is so far no mechanisms to help them (like moving walkways or staff manned carts). The speed at which a pax moves needs to be adjusted big time.

Im no coder myself so have no idea if this is salvageable but it seems like very poor coding. If you get above a couple of hundred passengers in your airport, it will get increasingly impossible to do anything. It seems the only thing working in the end is the part where your passengers get really annoyed at the situation. They cannot move, they will not change queue, you cannot build or change your queue-area, your janitors will essentially stop working, and nomatter what you click, you will not hit what you think you will hit - it seems completely random.

Be forewarned - this still puts the early in early access. If you are looking for things like tutorials, missions, a proper game world etc. then you will be disappointed. However, if you want to get to grips with the game before those features arrive, you might still be interested.

With no tutorial it'll take a few attempts before you figure out the optimum placement, or even what everything does, but playing around with terminal designs is quite fun and most importantly the passenger feedback is extremely transparent so your trial and error isn't maddeningly difficult or arbitrary. You'll (hopefully) soon find your way to making a decent profit and expanding, hiring a CFO and COO to help you expand fiscally and physically, and dealing with bigger airlines - and bigger planes - as time goes on.

But time will go on and in the end it doesn't go anywhere: there is no mission complete, there is no goal. Those will come in time.

There is not enough possibilities at the moment to fill the empty spaces in the airport terminal with what you would typically find in an airport (Duty free shops, first class lounge, parkings...) meaning that once I have all the services available, the only expansion possibility is to add more runaways and mor gates to increase trafic.

That said..  This is a gem!.
Trying to manage multiple aspects of the airport at once can be a challange, but thankfully you are eased into it with a pretty sluggish start.  Which isnt a bad thing.  Building is Expensive to say the least, but then... it would be.. this is an airport. Nothing is cheap here..  
As it stands right now (8/15/2017), the AI is a little janky, a few Path finding issues but nothing totally game breaking.. and this is **.
The aircraft have a few issues with collision avoidance, I keep waiting for the Fireball on the runway.... (possibly something we might see in the future deliberaly?)
Disasters right now are mostly created by breaking security and causing Aircraft to miss their timeslot in your carefully managed schedule.
Keeping the peeps happy ""seems"" to be simple.  With little effort I have not seen their happiness drop below 90%.  **, so this will probably change in future.
Like Prison Architect, this is one of those games that will lull you into a false sence of security, and the moment you overlook a small detail you are staring down almost complete disaster.. in this case, bankruptsy...  
Getting the baggage conveyors working and the kitchens working is a bit of a trial and error thing, but once you do it becomes a fire and forget kind of thing.
Dont expect to be managing the ground crew or the taxiway procedures, that isnt part of this game... Although it would be a giggle later on...  for those sadists who want even more to micromanage every aspect of the Airport.

76561198344523676,598330,True,0,0,0,80133,48343,11,2,"UPDATE 6/16/2018:

I wanted to update this review again now some many months later on in play. As you can see, with close to 800 hours of play, I'm hooked. Why? It keeps getting better and refning in ways that are nothing short of spectacular. 

When I started playing, things were still being developed to improve the overall impact/effect of the gameplay. And while there were some issues, over time it became the ultimate airport build simulator possible. Each step forward has been that much better than the last. And along with it, some very nifty challenges in game play & attributes. 

As I said in the previous update, this is not the sim for people who want fantasy. It is, without any doubt, suited for people who love airlines & love to see how much better they can make an airport at any given time. It is a game you will take a while to learn... and only a momen to love. 

Building construction is easy, and is user-variable... depending on how much you want to spend. And with that comes other challenges: Expanding your airport's capacity, keeping peeps happy, and most importantly, not pissing off your airline customers. The challenge grows with your airport side, and with nearly limitless possibililtes, the vision and future is yours. 

I've been playing simulation games since the Commodore 64, some 30 plus years ago. SimAirport fits in well within the definitive Sims/Sims II, Simcity 3000, Theme Hospital & RollerCoaster Tycoon 2.0 - it is that great a product, with nearly flawless gameplay.


What can I say about this game?  Well - if you love airlines, love airports or love building and finding the best solutions for things - it's DEFINITELY for you.  I have seldom come across a build-sim game that targets these three areas so beautifully - and with such great open-ended performance. 

Now mind you, if you're looking for another SimCity/The Sims/RCT II, please stop now. This is a very specific game for airline people or for people who love to solve unusual or difficult challenges in moving people from A to B to A again. 

As the game is in early access, there can be some issues - and that is to be expected. But in some 6 weeks since I purchased the game, I've had a <single> crash - and beyond that, the faults have been very minor. The producers of the game should stand up and take a bow to create something so stable & fun when IT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT! Personally, this is astounding in so many ways. 

As for game function, it does take a bit of time to figure through the menus - but nothing too complicated that reading the notes on Steam or asking questions in the forum can't solve. 

The graphics are quite nice - seeing the planes pull in, the peeps getting off the plane, and heading to baggage claim... then the peeps boarding the plane and it leaves. Combine that with baggage systems and the other basic facets of the airport, and you have something astounding to work with. The possibilities are endless - and you do have a 'sandbox' mode to build your ultra-mega airport without having the funding issues.  It is however a challenge to start with the basic airport - and to grow it from there (very much like the real thing...) 

In the future, I look forward to seeing what else they will add into the game - and to help improve the speed and functionality of the game. (Right now, lots of peeps = slower performance... something that can be a little fussy.) 

Overall, there is very little that I am unhappy with - and the improvements are getting better by the month.

Starting the game and about 2 minutes in I realized it was far from being as good as either afore mentioned titles.  The starting airport is a joke, the economy is horribly broken, and the game lags bad.  I had to run my airport for about 8 hours to have enough money to expand only 1 gate.

It has only gotten worse with the last large update with baggage hubs.  Not only are they a bad idea, but they are confusing, extremely expensive, and constraining.  What was wrong with the old version?

Graphics as mentioned above are a clone of Prison Architect, as is the UI.  That made it a bit easier to find stuff and know how to build, but they copied an old build as zooming into a zone doesn't filter to only show items relevant to that zone.  Also it looks horrible having the zones always show on the map.  Nothing like staring at a bunch of diagonal lines the whole time.

The AI is really poor.  People go around outside zones and ignore sidewalks going directly into the terminal.  Queues are beyond stupid as they pile up in clumps, and the sounds at the security stations are annoying. 

While the devs are always doing updates, the game is probably a good 6 months early to release yet, and it's already been taking money a while.  

I recommend you check on Steam for similar games and pass on this one until it matures.  If you love the graphics then get Rimworld or Prison Architect, both are vastly superior.",1501383952,1501383952

I want to love this game. I really do. Airport Architect? An actual airport tycoon-esque game? I want it. 
I understand it is in Early Access; but I wouldn't even call this Alpha. 

The UI is clunky. The middle mouse scrolling is inverted to what you'd be used to and is WAY too sensitive. 
FPS chugs at larger airports (but I had to DL an airport to check cus I couldn't fathom it out myself).

No tutorial. Not even a welcome message or anything explaining even BRIEFLY what you should do.
Baggage system is absolutely broken. Five times I tried to hook ticketing desks to the baggage depot and every time I got ""not connected to baggage desks"" even though the coloured overlay said it WAS connected.

The beginning airport is also horrid so you might as well start from scratch.
Oh and I constantly had passengers getting stuck at security for no good discernable reason.

This at the moment should be given to select people to play test. Not put out onto Steam EA, and especially not for £18.99! This is by no way, or stretch of the imagination, a full complete game warrenting that price tag. Refund requested.

I'm sure I will change this to a recommended, but currently there is absolutely no challenge.  
  
Things that need improvement: 
1. When sims miss their flight you have no idea where in the process their day went wrong.
2. There are no bullets to dodge- Security screening is required (and it shouldn't be) but don't do anything. The game should have things like airline strikes, bankrupcies, terrorist activities (you let a bomb through and blew up an off screen plane, you're getting hit with - rep, a financial judgement, etc.)  
3. No tutorial
4. Pathfinding is poor
5. AI logic is poor- if you have 10 ticket booths, the AI might cue up at 3 of them at a rate of 30 people deep and leave the rest empty.

Sooooooooo much potential to still be fulfilled

A Yeay later: Same issues does persists, when building or demolishing, and having above 1000 PAX, the game begins to have medium lags. The medium lags are not the problem per say, the issue is the pathfinding of the passengers, they tend to get stuck a lot more, having to re-think their path, and just stand still, leading to several delays, and passengers missing their flights.

Multilevel is okay, but kind a dumb that you cannot dictate at which floor your planestand connects to. Baggage system are also still not very intuitive, and not easy to manage, if you are a new player. 

The game still needs more technologies to research, and it would be nice to have more restrictions as to what you can build, in the entrylevel, i.e concrete runway VS asphalt runway, giving a feeling of development over time. As the game is now, after a few hours, developement ceases, and it just becomes a mater of expanding and trying layouts.

Here we are again, another year or two, and lots of hours.

I still really LOVE the feeling and the vibe that this game gives, but the game is still broken in its core, once you get over a non specified threshhold. 4 XL gates( Still only using 4 out of the 10 build) , about 20 planes and 8000 pax a day, and the AI keeps losing its shit. Passengers lose its smart pathfinding, taking the long walk instead of walkways, builders stop building, even though materials are present, workers don't use their assigned places and so on. 
I thought at first that it was my planning that was wrong, but every time, after a quick reload, A.I gets back on track, as if nothing had happened.

Airlines don't give a shit about pricing, as I had turned everything all the way up, with absolutely NO support functions, don't even have a toilet for the passengers, and floors are bare concrete.

I still feel that there is missing way more research, and it should be more expensive, as to keep the goal of progress intact. 
Not counting when AI is lost in the milkyway, after very few hours, you can just let your airport run at full speed, watch an episode on netflix, and come back and spend money, and repeat. 

There are still some very idiotic restrictions for constructions and zones, i.e Walkways cannot be in or cross zones.

I'm afraid that this is as good as it will ever be, more or less.
I'm off to try Airport CEO in stead",1501010875,1617538356

Too simple, not a great conmparison? I dunno I spent 70 minutes playing the game before requesting a refund. The simple reason the total lack of any form of tutorial, the frankly awful UI that does deliver a few tool tips but seems to have three buttons that could contain any one of the things that you are meant to building not that you will know what you're meant to be building because, like I said, their is nothing even close to a tutorial in this game.

So here's how many experience with the game went. Loaded it up selected new game expected some sort of tool tip or pop up to give me some guidelines on at least where I should start. When nothing appeared I started just messing around playing with options, clicking buttons and seeing what's what. So my first game got me as far as drawing a few queue lines, cause we all love queues and wondering why no planes and no people seemed to come to my airport.

I decided that the schedule button would maybe have something to do with it only to find that upon opening this menu I needed to do some research on a specific topic which upon looking in the research menu didn;t seem to either be unlocked yet or exist.

So first look at a let's play video (Hint to the developer: LET'S PLAY VIDEOS IS NOT HOW NEW PLAYERS TO YOUR GAME SHOULD BE LEARNING ABOUT THE BASICS OF YOUR GAME.)

So my first let's play video had intorduced me to the basic concepts, I can maybe finally start making an airport.

My second attempt at an airport went something like this, drew some more queues, like I said everyone loves queues. Finally found out where and how to get planes to come to my airport and finally started getting people arriving and using my airport. Whoop we are starting to get somewhere, decided to make myself a proper baggage handling line, set everything up only to find a flashing ! mark on my taxiway delivery system telling me that it needed to be connected to both a ticket desk as well as a baggage carousel. Hmmm well I've joined the blue arrows and the pink arrows via a baggage line, won't else should I do? Good question because with no tutorial you could be left wondering. So I demolished re laid, sorted and tweaked and still kept getting the same error.

So time for my second let's play video

Have now watched my second let's play and it seems I haven't done anything differently to the guy in the video, expect his baggage system works and mine keeps flashing an error at me. Opt to demolish the system totally and try expanding my airport only to find that selecting wall and trying to draw a wall gives you the error 'cannot be placed outside' yeah a WALL that CAN'T be placed OUTSIDE. This is where I go back toi Prison Architect and go looking for a foundation or some other building placing icon. I don't find it and opt to give up and refund this game here.

So time for my third let's play video

Now maybe I am a glutton for punishment, maybe I am stupid, who knows but I opt to watch another let's play video on this game.

So here we are, this time I now know that their IS a foundation button expect that it is in another menu and due to some issue with the game currently displays the letter N with 'foundatio' being obscured inside the icon. Yup EA, and my rapidly rising levels of annouance with this game are to blame for missing it the last time. So I expand my airport, build a better security area, get a 6 plane schedule running, improve my ticketing area and start to set up my baggage system again and yet again the ! error message appears, again I spend some time messing around, testiung retesting and then give up.

To put it simply the game is awful, it's not the fact that it lacks a tutorial it's the fact that it lacks any form of guidance what so ever. The issue with baggage set up I dunno what it is, if it's a bug then yeah fool me but if it's because I didn;t setup or lay down the baggage lines in some magical specific manner or order then surely THIS is something that should at least explained within the game. The fact that I had to refer to a let's play video not once, not twice but three times just to get the very basics of how to start the game let alone the more complex systems that may get introduced to the game at a later stage is frankly unforgiveable.

The game is EA just now I perhaps at a later stage a full more detail and clear tutorial on the games concepts may get introduced but the problem is that given the game doesn't explain anything to you you're stuck in this awful area of wondering is something isn;t working because it's an EA bug or because you haven't understood the finer details of how a concept within the game is suppossed to work and frankly it means the game isn't fun and as such I cannot recommend the game in it's current state.

[h1] It's all just a big scam. [/h1]

When I first bought this game in march, I thought this game would be at some point complete, and I understood the developers were taking so long.
But now, the updates have worsened, and what is an ""update"" is usually something added to your expenses to make you less money.

In June, I found out about Airport CEO, a game that looked very polished, realistic, and of huge variety, even from pre-alpha stages.
I am now waiting for Airport CEO to come out, this game was a waste.

If SimAirport really wants to improve, they need to add more variety. Shops are confined to just a ""retail"" zone, same with restaraunts. They could also add contracts from companies to build highways, parking, etc. 

There is plenty more things to talk about, but you can just go to https://www.airportceo.com/ to see it all.

If SimAirport wants to continue, it must learn to strengthen up before it gets washed away by competition.

That is it, I have no more to say. If you want to see more, just go to the website 2 sentences above this one.

UPDATE:after using the experimental update 

The baggage system has improved and hopefully they are heading in the right track in making it less confusing and silly , game is early access so benefit of the doubt , game its self is fun but at current stage is a bit stare at the screen and wait for ur money to go high enough to build something else , lacking alot but to be fair they do have alot planned , time will tell if it comes to pruition .overall recomended IF  you think long term you would really enjoy , not in its current EARLY ACCESS  form though

hugely overpriced for ""current"" content will need alot more before its worth its price

update august 2017:a month with nothing , nowt no patch no updates , looks like a possible abandoned game

UPDATE Nov 2017 

Interface is cleaner and smarter , fair play 

Baggage handling is EVEN worse , avoid this fiddly , messy , over complicated shambles

UPDATE april 2018

So after devs saying baggage was fine they have changed it again(funny that) and its EVEN  WORSE , more silly and complicated , taking every last inch of fun out of the game , alot of youtubers do not play this anymore , alot of gamers i know (well 11) have given up on the game due to this restrictive , pointless complicated system AVOID PEOPLE",1500296900,1523999781

 When you Unlock financing through your office you can unlock ""Change Prices"" Which allows players to configure the amount of money each airline has to pay. This is basically a cash cow. You can accept loads of planes then bump up the prices and watch the money flying in. I left it idle for 30 mins I came back with 4 million dollars. I think that if you up the prices the planes should stop coming to your airport. 

I'd like to see the implentation of shops and other things to really make the game feel fun. I'd also love if you gave difficulty options such as ""Economic Crisis"" Or ""Economic Boom"" The boom would be the easy one. I'd like to see the use of fire engines and other services around the airport. Along with airport parking and long term parking. I believe charging people to stay in these areas would really make the game more challenging as you require more space for car parks that can be expensive. 

I'd also love to see plane crashes and terrorist activity where your police officers put down a criminal before he/she does damage. There is so much you guys can expand on. I liove the base game but with some extra work I believe your sitting on a master piece.",1500049549,1500049549

Some full release AAA titles in my library haven't even got that play time from me.  This play time sums it up prefectly, and proves that sometimes the simplest of games are the best.

I come from a gaming background that stretches waaay back to the eighties on a C64, so have seen my fair share of games over the years.  The last time I was addicted to a game as much as this was with SWOS back in the 90's.

Things I like:

- Addictive gameplay (the most important attribute of a game for me)
- Freedom to create an airport anyway you like (within the limits of the game mechanics)
- Detailed, but not overwhelming
- Regular updates and bug fixes
- Good balance between realism and fun
- Great range of aircraft types
- Addictive gameplay (did I mention that already?!)
- Ability to plan your airport layout as an overlay (very handy)
- Option to ""break deadlock"" for almost any process in the game that gets stuck (EA, so a good thing to have)
- Extremely stable for EA, not had one game breaking issue yet
- Day/night cycle
- Weather cycle that affects runways in use
- Runways have optional PAPI, ILS, lights (one for the aviation geeks and was a pleasant surprise for me)
- Very detailed baggage system that is a joy to figure out to get the optimum layout (a game within the game almost!)
- Decent amount of objects to choose from (with more to follow)

Things I would like to see improved/added (in no way are these gamebreaking or horrible to live with/without):

- The bank loan system could be more detailed/realistic (but is fine for now)
- Add a detailed tutorial (however it is relatively easy to figure out - another sign of a good game)
- Add more variety to game textures (gates/taxiways/walls/windows/outdoor flooring/runways/grass/desert...)
- Add ability to create custom airline liveries (hopefully workshop may add this function)
- More airlines (currently only about 15-20 from what I can remember)
- Implement real ""days of the week"" rather than simply ""day 1, day 2, day 3"" etc (right now the schedule only allows for aircraft to arrive and depart every day at the same time, it would be good, for example, to only have a certain 747 or 380 arrive maybe twice a week, adding variety to the schedule)
- More options for outside the airport, like carparks, bus depots etc. Right now it's just a road with a drop off and pickup.
- Better looking status window, maybe make it look like a real airport arrival/departure board for immersion.
- Can get a wee bit laggy when airport gets busy, but not terrible
- Aircraft turnaround times are a bit bugged I feel. Like I've found if you don't give a 737 at least a 2 hour or more turnaround it will often leave without all passengers on board, making them unhappy (airline and passengers). IRL some 737's or 320's are turned around in 1/2 an hour.  Maybe it's just my airport layout and the fact that passengers can't get to the gate quick enough, but I'm not sure about this as I see them queing at security almost 2 hours before departure.

I could go on and on describing improvements/additions. However, this is an EA title afterall and is contantly evolving. I can tell already from this version that the devs are passionate about the subject matter and the game itself - which means it can only get better.

Should you buy it now?:

I would have no problem recommending the game in it's current state.  Like I said, I have many AAA titles in my collection that I wouldn't give this much time of day to for one reason or another, but mostly because they are just not very good games.  If, like me, you long for a game that reminds you of how games used to be, and how they made you feel by being so addictive that you were even thinking of strategies whilst driving to work IRL - then this is the game for you.

You don't neccessarily have to have a passion for aviation to enjoy it - but if you do it will only enhance your experience. The game looks simple on the surface but there is a hidden depth to it that makes it very addictive and enjoyable to learn. Give it a couple of hours, and watch a few you tube vids for the bits you can't figure out, and you will not look back.

The first Steam purchase I haven't felt guilty about in a long long time. Worth every penny.

Firstly this is alpha and you come here knowing that. If you don't get what alpha is then stay away. Like all alpha projects this will have bugs, quirks and underdeveloped parts. You will lose saved games and have to start all over again when new features are introduced. If you get emotionally invested in your ‘designs’ then this is not for you yet,  but I would strongly urge you to at least monitor the progress.

And progress is what you will get in abundance. I have waited for a decent airport sim games since Amiga times and there hasn’t been one. Suddenly we have two contenders and both will get my attention. But SimAirport is the first to the blocks.  (The other nameless sim will no doubt provide stiff competition but it is clear it will appeal to a slightly different audience.)
The key thing with this is the rate of development and updaters. If you are prepared to tolerate the experimental branch then you can enjoy almost nightly updates. If you can’t tolerate that then updates are about monthly. But the thing is that those daily updates will more often than not swot bugs and add features. For example we have just seen a major overhaul of the baggage system. Now some people didn’t like it at first but deep down actually they all know it is for the better. 
I love the updates and the drip feeding of new ideas. I even admit to getting a little excited to read the update notes every evening. When that happens you know you are on to something. 
Game play at present is simple but fun. And it mainly focuses around design and passenger flow. As a big sim fan I am very comfortable just sitting and watching the queues form, the passengers board their plans and the janitor clean the mess. Again if this is not your cup of tea, steer clear. 
The graphics at present are a little cartoonish but actually after a while you can see it works much like that prison game…. Admittedly it does frustrate me when they walk through queue barriers and other obstacles but hey, this is alpha. 
Some other things I hope the developers develop is increasing the business side of things. I would not want to see a micromanagement form of business but things such as wages, international V domestic routing, more detailed contract negotiation etc would be good. Also cannot wait for duty free and newspaper stands to arrive as well as travelators which we know is close to hand.  Plus I would quite like to see some diagonals: it’s all right angles at present. 

Also we need to see some code streamlining as the program still lags at high passenger numbers but the thing is the developers know this and are actively looking at it. 

Pricing wise: yes probably a little step for an alpha but in general the type of people who are into this type of sim aren’t young FPS types and we are often prepared to pay a little more for these admittedly niche games.

All in all get on the bandwagon if this ticks all the boxes. If in doubt check out the YouTube channels. Long may the developers develop this.

For that there are already plenty of possibilities to create your own airport with gates, many planes (Airbus, Boing, etc.) in any size and with different requirements.
Also you need a bit of micro-management which is necessary to optimize the timing of flights at the gates and on the taxiway.

Though it is still in developement, SimAirport is one of only a few games I am totally fixed on at the moment. Because the developer is very active (nearly every day a experimental update with bugfixes and new features) and keeps direct contact to the community, I am confident with this interpretation of Early Access and hope the developer will keep the pace for an even better result.
The actual price of about 20 dollars seems at first sight a bit high, but is -in my opinion- totally worth it.

After building my first Airport, I love this game. This game is super knowing that the game is in Early Access, the game is amaing. I mean not everything is amazing in the game cause it's kinda empty. So here are a few things I WOULD LOVE to see this game have one day.

What I want it to have:


Security

● I'd like to one day see the security to accually be helpful. Right now, all it does is make the place be Secured I hope one day it makes the place secure still but people try to sneak bombs,guns,esc. into the airport.

● I think it would be really really cool if you could make patrol units for you Officers. 

● If you could arm you security with diffrent weapons, Guns, Tazers, handcuffs, flashlight, guard dogs, esc.

● I think it would be cool also if there were accidents on the planes before take off, like fighting,Assault, esc.

● Final thing for security, If a plane had to make a security landing for a passager for being drunk in air, esc, you could send officers to drag them off the planes ( Not like United no worries ).

● A serch room, esc.


Emergency's:

● Emergency landing would be cool, Emergency landing for Fires,Hijacking,broken gear, esc.

● A on-site Fire station, Most airports always have a fire startion somewhere on there grounds, so I think it would really help if this game would give you an option for a Fire house.

● Airport lockdowns, if there were a shooter in a airport they would lock it down correct? Then why not throw that in the game?!

● Machine mounfuctions, Let's be honest, The baggage carriers don't always work at airports, It would be amazing if stuff would accually break down, and when stuff break down you need machanics.

Bathrooms:

● I have one HUGE problem with the bathrooms, in the game they are just toilets no stalls or anything. It would be kinda wierd just looking arround seeing people do there buisnees in a airport. 

● The janitors always are killing me in this game, Why do they just run outside and just walk around, and when something happends (trash on the ground ) they come running in to clean it, like maybe make the janitors stay inside would be cool.

● Dirty bathrooms, so the janitors have to more then pick up trash.

Runways/taxiways:

● This is one of the worst things in the game currently just because of one thing, you can make certain planes go on certain runways, I tried doing this and it diden't work so I got so angrey, it would be cool if you could have one runway for Large planes and Extra Large planes. 

● Maybe Takeoff and Landing runways?

Shops:

● Vending machines are kinda boring, if your looking for realism, add a lot of diffrent shops, Cloths, souvieners, Electroinics, esc.

*Other*

● Have more then 1 floor

● Subways, Elevators, Transpertaion.

● Other cool arsh stuff

This game is super fun, and I can't wait to see it get better!

- airport manager that looks like it's based on Prison Architect engine (it is not), so same mechanics, look & feel
- basic systems are already in place and work mostly bugfree
- very responsive dev team, regular updates
- sandbox and career mode (career mode means fixed starting cash)
- create zones like ticketing, security, baggage claim, etc. to control passenger flow
- create cafes and build some vending machines and other stuff to get some money out of your passengers while they are clogging your terminal.
- build a baggage routing system to haul all that luggage to and from the planes
- flexible timeslots for flights, so if you think you can handle a 90 minute turnaround for that 747, go for it (good luck)
- build huge airports with multiple runways and lots of gates (see steam workshop for pics)

To the developers - If you are going to copy prison architect's ui, at least copy all of its good features and think up some things to do BETTER not worse!! Everything feels like prison architect but like a cheap copy and a REALLY bad one at that. I'm not usually one to bother tearing a game apart in a review but I mean come on, Copy the ui right, Not like a flash game from 2007.

SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR AIRPORT CEO!!

This one isn't worth $19.99 and surely will not hold you until that one gets early access.


I'm not even going to comment about the graphics or lack thereof. The inability to right click to deselect, etc. All the good details in prison architect are just flat out missing. You also have to research how to build roads.. WHAT?! Why?! That is so stupid, I was playing a sandbox mode and you still have to research everything, its literally pointless.

I waited months, maybe even more than a year, for the implementation of custom airlines so I could play with actual, and not fake, airlines.  Unfortunately, the implementation of custom/mod airlines is poorly done.

It's so overly complicated that it's just not fun to play. Setting up a beginning airport is so tedious. 

You can't really use actual airlines because the modding system makes it so difficult to not have errors. Every  mod seems to use different aircraft, and finding what aircraft is meant to go with each mod just to set the game up took me hours, and I still had error messages because I didn't have the right aircraft.

The modding system in game is basically broken for custom airlines.  ALL airlines remain even after unsubscribing, which means you have numerous different mods for one brand of airlines (three southwest).  When going to set up the game, all of them show up and you have no idea which one to pick for a single brand of airline, let alone trying to add multiple ones.

There is a ""hide"" airlines in game, but it's not much help because it doesn't allow you to remove the actual mods.  So you have to figure out which airline you're supposed to remove which is annoying.  I even went through and deleted files which should have removed all the mods I downloaded, but somehow, they keep showing back up.  And having two or three different mods for each airline (Delta x3, Southwest x2, etc) with most of them not updated or working correctly makes setting up the game nearly impossible.

A user (modair) was nice enough to answer a topic I made about custom airlines and aircraft, and linked a page which uses all the different aircraft that are required for his mods.  He clearly put in a lot of work into the mods and assistance to other players.   But after nearly five minutes of adding all the required aircraft, one by one which is required by the game, I wasn't even  halfway done.  At that point, I gave up.

That's just getting the game set up for using actual airlines.

I spent hours playing the game when it first came out, and it was a lot of fun.  Once you get in game, there are so many items in the game, it's tough to wrap your head around it.  There is a search function, which is fine, but I'd rather have a useful UI where I didn't have to search for each and every item when I try to install it. And you need to know the name of the item as it's written to search for it, for the most part.

I literally spent hours just trying to download and arrange custom airlines, making sure that the mods I was using used the correct aircraft mods.

Then, getting into the game, I was quickly put off by how difficult it was to actually create and manage the airport.

It runs stable. It never crashed on me and as long as you build reasonable airports, chances are good, that your computer can handle it. It starts to stutter once you get over a certain threshold, for me that's about 1000 passengers in the airport at the same time. It's still playable, but it stutters.

That being said, the content that is already there is enough to fill about 20-30 hours of playtime. Once you figure out the necessary ratios of things your airports will be successful and it is nice to just watch your airport function. Initially there's always something that needs tinkering, but after about 20 hours you hit a wall with no new goal or content being available. That's the price for early access. 

I recommend this game because right now, you get about 20 hours of playtime for 20 bucks, which comes to about a buck per hour. Most titles are more expensive for a single playthrough. And this one should get a lot more content in the future. Nonetheless it might be a good idea to wait for a sale before buying.",1495835655,1495835858

That being said, it's not without it's faults, and being early access, that is to be expected.  The game shows amazing potentiol, but at it's current state, is very limited.  I currently have built an airport that has about 3500 concurrent passengers traveling through it, and that's about as big as you are going to be able to build.  The current state of the game results in a severe slow down to the point that, at 5x speed, each minute takes about 2 seconds, which makes the game slow down to a crawl.  Another complaint is the dropoff/pickup location and traffic.  The AI for the traffic is worse that most chineese drivers which results is slow pickups and dropoffs and people missing flights for reasons beyond your control.  This, I hope, will be fixed with further updates.  Further updates, yes, these developers have shown that they are working very hard on this game and update is quite frequently.  

This is why I will actually recommend this game, even with it's faults and current state, I have had a lot of fun.  And it is early access, so it's to be expected that the game is not perfect.

there are some  flaws:

bagage system is de facto limited to one system. If you add a second system the bags are sent to random terminals, and your crew will have to switch each bag that is missplaced, (By chance 50 % of the bags 100 % of the time). Good luck keeping the schedule now. 

The tool for buying land is Broken. If I buy a strip of land next to a existing wall i pay 100%, if I increase to two lines i pay between 250  and 300 %. This means Theat if you dont build walls in one line segments building becomes extreamly expencive. 

Where prison architect made the game challanging by adding content(different rooms),  SimAirport is challanging based on building costs (the price of foundation). I realize the game is in alfa. But let me play a alpha game and foundate cheap. Dont extend gameplay time with big foundation costs

people in the cafeteria dont que up. Minor complaint, but it had been cool if the people formed in line instead of having 10 cafe goers standing in top of each other.

The whole balancing is not too great, constructing and expanding the airport is quite fussy. Graphics and animations are quite basic so far - and some bugs that pop up can be really annoying. It's interesting for an hour or two - then the game wears off quite fast. Given the amount of content, the bugs, the gameplay issues - the current price is not justified.

I revisited the game recently, after seeing a number of updates for the game were released. I've decided to change my review from negative to positive, because of the following changes:

- Generally the game seems more stable now, with less frequent bugs and quite a bit better performance.
- Multiple floors have added a lot of interesting options and complexity to the game, so have a number of other features which I won't be listing separetely.

Currently playing with the experimental build. Passenger AI is still weird sometimes and I dislike all the passengers using the same path, instead of the full path width for example. The passengers also queue up for my metal detectors while some detectors are not being used at all. This however does not affect the game (and flight schedule) much because they get through quick enough.

One idea I had is that windows can let Environment through. Meaning bushes that are (right) outside the window can also affect passengers. I would also love to see the ability for planes to transfer to a different gate if one is taken. Right now the flight cancels when arrival at the gate is not possible. If another gate is free (and will be free for the planned groundtime) the plane can switch gates and still arrive.

Just now I started to experience lag with 3 large gates, 2 small gates, busy schedule(27 flights) with big planes on the biggest map. I try to spread out all areas and improve passenger flow where I can. Not too long ago I still had 60fps with smaller flights on the schedule.

The developers definitely have an understanding of the economics of running an airport and even if you don't, you will quickly become immersed in the mechanics.

SimAirport gives players a wealth of mechanics to alter and tailor their gameplay experience to their own tempo. Players have the ability to customise their flight schedules, choose which flight contracts to take, what size planes land at the airport and which gate the planes land at amongst many other things.
Different size planes carry more passangers, with more passangers comes greater efficiency challenges which can be overcome through managing your schedules, adding more ticketing desks, optimising your security, adding more service staff to boarding gates etc.

SimAirport has all the functional elements in to be able to run your very own Airport business and will hopefully just get better as Early Access goes on.
If you are familiar with Prison Architect style games you will love this. 

Pros:

- Functional base game mechanics. Baggage, flights, passengers, retail system, garbage, storage, offices for staff.
- Queueing system is excellent once you learn how to do it. (You can assign service desks to queues, otherwise customers ignore the queues)
- Excellent, simple schedule interface for managing flights and gates.
- Passengers give visible feedback on things affecting them like ""ARGH"" when they have missed their flight, ""no staff?"" when they did not get served at a cafe in time etc.
- Choice of flights and planes that arrive at your airport. Each plan has different passenger capacity.
-Different airlines have different plan visuals, they are neat.
- Lots of efficiency optimisation and progression mechanics which feel fluid and structured without being linear
- Functioning research system, albeit very limited at the moment.
- Simple staff system, you just plop them and they do their jobs without having to micro-manage. 
- There is a cost to firing staff, making your business and staffing choices more valuable.
- Immersive sound effects and visuals
- The animation when a gate attaches to a landed plane is radical.
- Warnings and clear signals as to why something isn't working.

Cons:

- No tutorial at the time of review. This will be a barrier to new players to the genre. If you aren't familiar with mechanics of Prison Architect style games you will have trouble getting your head around the game, how to build etc. Also limited fan-made tutorials on youtube/internet as the game is new.
- You will fail your first few airports while learning how everything comes together. 
- Only way to deal with larger amounts of passengers is to add lots of boarding/gate desks for each gate which feels a bit clumsy. In order to board an A380 (~550 passengers) you need about 5 boarding desks to board in a decent time frame. This is also the case with cafe's and cash registers. A suggestion would be research to check people on faster or more efficient/higher tiered vewrsions of service desks and gate desks or an ""online check-in"" research.
- It's Early Access. More features should be on the way. I'd say the price is worth it but a part of that includes an expectation of expanded features. There's no guarentee of that.",1493354991,1493354991

You see, you just need to overcrowd your airport and distract your passengers with cafes, lots of them, so that they will forget about their flight and go Argh! as it departs. You may end up with a small impact of frustration but too little to be concerned since you have thousands of passengers at the airport anyways.

So how exactly does that improve airline interest? Well I guess I ensured they get to depart on time so that they get to charge their no-show customers extra for a separate flight ;)

I have just started playing this game again after a couple of months off. i found that there has been a couple of updates. some of the updates were nice to see the baggage lines are really good i like them and they seem to work well.
the little shops worked ok not many people seem to use them  much. so i built a cafe which was not a good idea the cafes are still not working that great by the looks of things, i had over 1500 people coming thru the airport people were getting stuck and missing their planes now you might say i didn't have enough workers but i over 100 working in the cafe most of them just standing around. so i built another cafe to try and help but that made things worse the workers were going back and forth. 
Look i guess what i am trying to say is I do really like this game i wouldn't play it this much if i didn't and it does look like the guys have put a lot of working into since the last time but they are just not there yet.
I like that we now can play with the time of the loading of the plane as the big planes still need a lot of time i have my time pushed out to 4hrs and some people still missed the planes (how much time do they need)
So the game it self is playable but i just wouldn't be putting that much time into it just yet. 
but i would like to say they are doing a great job so stick with it keep the updates coming cos i am really looking forward to playing is all the way through.

The game is currently so lacking in content that it is incredibly boring after a few hours, there are loads of bugs, and the restaurant aspect does not work properly. The game runs very badly, so that it freezes as soon as you have an airport with too much content in it.

I am very disappointed and feel that for the price it is a complete rip-off as there is so little in the game at this stage.

Next... 

3 terminals into the game, this program really gets laggy. I don't mean a little, it REALLY gets laggy. To the point of unplayable. Now, it's an EARLY RELEASE game. So, I am not complaining, just stating the facts. 

Developers, this should be priority one. 

There are a few other tweaks needed..

1. Better ability to route customers through the airport. Not always egressing back through the security gate.. 

2. Better dsiplay of income and expense. Not grreen text big and bold over green grass. That can be cleaned up.

3. Better manipulation of arrival, departure times, plus the ability to have aircarft hold without just cancelling a flight. 

There is a lot of work to do, but I would not dismess this game yet.

Bugs since latest April 19th update:
-Passangers getting stuck randomly in the open. (New, never was a bug before the update)
-Passangers get to the gates at the last few minutes making the flight leave late, even when passangers are already past security.
-Passangers will be in places like cafes or bathrooms past the depature time, then being upset even when they were at fault for missing the flight, like half of the passangers, not a few.
-Scheduling could be greatly improved, but it is better than before with exdending times.
-Empolyees roaming, for example foodstand staff roam too much even when you have double.

If you remember airport tycoon back in the day its similar to that but way better as the Devs are adding things all the time and keep listening to feedback. 

Definately one to watch or buy.

The people who can't stand glitches and issues and are giving do not recommend are missing the entire point of the early access.

That said, I would totally recommend buying this game, but only if you are willing to share and report any issues you have to the devs. They do an amazing issue at rectifying issues as best as they can and as quickly as they can. There will be more improvements in the future and more gameplay features. Will there be broken saves and hiccups in the future during early access? Of course. But they will be resolved in time to make SimAirport a complete game whenever it releases officially. The development team is doing an amazing job and they prove that they care about the community. Not every dev team or company can say that these days with the norm often being rushing a bugged product out quickly and patch it later in order to meet a corporate deadline.

I have also seen some concerns with the game becoming laggy. However, if you opt into the experimental betas (right click the game on steam > properties > betas), you will see that the experimental beta has fixed the lag for the most part with AI improvements. The devs release almost daily patches depending on community input to quickly resolve any issues.",1492343027,1492343027

For the ones who want to try large scale airport, please go to Edge branch.

The preformance has been greatly imporved in the Edge. Now the game is playable under 3000 ppl scenario. Although there are still some bugs, like passenage crowd, not moving, etc, overall is moving to a good direction.

================= Comments in July 2016 =========================
Recently I pick up this game again. Really can see and feel the effort by the developer. The future plan is also exciting and attractive. In short, it is quite an interesting and unique airport simulation game. 

However, the performance is still a big issue. When passengers > 1500, the game lags terribly. CPU(i7-6700HQ) is not fully utilized, roughly 30%. Since each element, such as passengers, workers, planes, etc, is independent entity, the parallel computing can be used. Don't understand why CPU is so low.

So, please deal with performance first before any other plans. As long as the performance is not solved, it is pointless to develop more content. Only big airport need more content.

================= Comments in August 2017 =========================
I would like say, potential game but not worth the price at this stage. 

The most critical issue for the developers is the algorithms they are using.

1. When the number of people in the terminal increases, the whole game became un-playable. Many people says, pls optimize the game, but from my point of view, it is people routing algorithm issue. Let's say if each people need to use make their own decision from origin to destination, then u need to find the shortest path once, if there are other activities, like visit cafe area, rest room, then there are more decisions to make. Btw, shortest path algorithm is resource consuming if solution space is huge, not matter which variations u r using. My suggestion to this is to reduce the solution space, for example, for unboarding people and boarding people, mark the region they can visit. Or instead of tracking each people, use people flow to represent, and randomly generate some actions.

2, vehicle and plane routing and detouring algorithms: for vehicle, easy to get stuck if using two lanes, u can always see vehicles always change lanes. Again, reduce the solution space.
For plane, if two are face to face, then one need to turn back, but if a third one is behind, then turn back again. For this, I think First Come First Serve, and path reservation can be tested. Means whenever a plane occupies the path, then it will move first, the others have to wait at junction.

In short, this game is not just a game, you need to consider it as Simulation and Optimization platform, many articles you may want to search around.",1492314308,1502543621

Pros:

Most bugs in the initial release seem to have been fixed. When I read the reviews, I was put off due to the number of negative ones, but after watching some play throughs on YouTube I decided to give it ago. I have had no major bugs or glitches; yes, there are some but it is an early release it comes with the territory.

The road system is brilliant, I have spent easily the last hour trying to make a road system that would avoid too much congestion, I had mixed results (luckily, I had a nice bank balance as asphalt costs a lot).

The materials system is good. When you dismantle something, it breaks down into the materials required to build it. This is such a good feature as quite often I have removed roads I have built so I could build taxiways.

The controls are easy to understand (like Prison Architect). I would just like a better control over zooming as it seems to go from close to quite far away, I would like something in between.

The whole concept is fantastic I have played other airport games but this gives you complete freedom. Several times when I have saved up I have bulldozed my airport and started again. Or I have expanded gradually so not to affect the airport running.

The planning tool is a major help, I look forward to seeing how this will develop as so far it is only colours.

There are probably many more things but those are the main ones. I will say I think £19.00 is a lot and that did but me off initially as I normally only pay £10 max for early release but I am glad I gave it a go and have loved every minute. I think with the price you need to make your own decision.

Here are few things that could be improved as I can't think of anything negative to say. Some of these could be in the pipeline of the devs.


Improvements

A few glitches here and there - my main glitches seem to be baggage carts just randomly left on taxi ways (though I think that's due to me dismantling the hanger without selling the carts).

Performance upgrades as when I build a larger airport I lag like crazy, though I have found saving and reloading does fix a this and other issues such as garbage not being moved as I deleted and moved the garbage zone.

Queues - They are a great help but can be annoying when putting down, think it would be much simpler if you left click to create the queue and right click deletes it.

Storage - I would really like a storage area as when I remodel I have boxes everywhere! I thought maybe using the storage racks for that instead of new deliveries would help.

Staff - I think there needs to be subcategories for staff. Mainly the food workers as they should have three categories - cooks, cashiers and waiter/waitress. Also, staff could be gate staff and ticket staff as that would give much better control where everything goes.

Assignment - A restructure of the assignment facility would be nice as when more than one queue is next to each other it can be hard to select the correct one.

Duty free - would be great if in in future there could be duty free.

So basically in my opinion this is a great game, for me personally £20 is quite a lot but I have been pleasantly surprised. I am expecting to spend most of my time on SimAiport when not at work. I am looking to forward to seeing how this game develops over time.

[b]Additional functions that should be added[/b]

Set the sum of moey wich you start with in feeplay mode - It should also be allowed to play with unlimited in freeplay mode.

More starting airports - This has annoyed me for a while, there is only one starting airport. I suppose there soon will be added a function to select other airports as well.

Bussgate - A gate that does not require much space in the terminal building, but i requires a bus to go from the terminal to the gate, and aslo a stair vehicle. This kind of gate should be cheaper for the airline to use.

Automatic check-in counter -  Allows passangers to scan their boarding passes, faster than the other chek-in desks. This one requiers one check-in desk with staff besides it. (They have to be connected)

Travel agencies - Helps to fill up planes, and the airport recives a set part of the money.

Airline offices - Help passangers who have complaints, or that has to rebook because their flight was cancelled.

Help desk - Lost lost bagage etc.

Car rental firms - Allow passengers to rent car from different companies at the airport. The airport recives a % of their income (It should be possible to have mutiple companies).

Garage - Here can the passangers pick up /dropp of their rental cars or park their own.

Improved resarch menu- Make sub catories, so when one clicks finance it shows Bankloan etc. Also there should be added more reseach. Maybe security is possible to improve? To get dogs, or narco scanners.

Grants/Missions -You recive some money before and after you have completed it.

Security - The bag claim should be in a seperate area of the aiport where only arriving passangers can enter, they should also have another way to there than trough the security control. Functions like mentioned above should also be added.

Costum office - Should be added by the exit of bag claim. (If any discovers airport earns a %)

Duty free - Here the passangers can by their tobacco, candy, alcohol etc.


At the check-in - Bag self-drop, requires the passanger to check-in at a machine then go to a self-drop desk, no staff only a conveyor belt.

Gate naming - It should be possible to rename the gates, and also they should be automatic renamed when they are built in-between to gates, so it is A1-A2-A3, and not A1-A3-A2.

Multiple terminals - It should be possible to set buildings as a different terminal, so that the aiport gets larger, also it should be possible to set gatenames to B1, C1, to mark  different terminal or area.

Pre-made rooms - Possible to reserach, makes it easier for the player to construct rooms.

Wall-demolishing - It is not possible to demolish walls inside, this is very annoying due to the fact that if you build a new area it has a tendency to become square walls (double walls).

Foundation - A little high priced?

Objects lights up - To make the building prosses easier once the user is over a room, relevant objects light up.

When a plane has been scheduled, it should be possible to drag it from one side to the other side (Scrolling)

Taks - If the user plays the carrer mode it should be stages and more tasks.



This list is not organized and I am truly sorry. But I hope this ideas will be taken into concideration :)

I cant tell whether this is caused from the number of passengers, or something else, but it is something to be aware of.

Pros:
[olist]
[*] Good graphics
[*] Constistantly evolving world
[*] Time consuming - could be a con.
[*] Challenging at times
[*] methodical Thinking[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
[*] Frame Loss in late game
[*] Lacking a main menu
[*] Texture Glitches
[*] Planes having trouble on Runway - getting stuck between other planes on taxiways.
[*] Small plot of land - Possible to expand outwards perhaps?[/olist]


Score: 7/10 - A Good Enjoyable Game
Overview: Lots of potential for this game, and hopefully the devs will continue to create more towards this little gem and fix up some of the issues and add more on. At its current price I wouldnt say it is far off, but at £18.99 it isnt worth that much as of yet. However if some more patches come along and it gets a main menu, then i would strongly recommend picking this one up.

Downsides are that the game becomes laggy when operating a huge terminal of your dreams, and many features are yet to be implemented. However, the developers are proven to be highly committed, competent and engaging with players - fixing bugs rapidly and introducing new functionality every other day (if you're in the experimental mode).

I downloaded SimAirport Yesterday and I love it I played the old school Airport tycoon released April 25, 2000, which was amazing and a lot of fun much like this new game. 

I have noticed a few things that for me would improve the game.

Im sure you guys have hearded this all ready but here you go.

-Roads (Need more roads in and out)

- Building ( The foundations- This should let you build the walls were you would like and all the floor also.

Queue- When assising the queue would be nice if you could move the tab so the queue close by are not blocked.

The lagging- im sure you no. ( When builders do anything the game comes to a stop nearly and much more this is the Big one it this was fixed it would be amazing)

Plane- options Eg. (Taxi, Hold, Board) 

Shops- Ability to buy shop would be great 

Converor line- Ticketing Desk should beable to snap in to each other.


Objects could have move tabs and categories.

Utilities- should have and escalator


Keep up the good work loving it.

Thanks 

Kind Regards

The big hitch that I, and many others appear to be experiencing, is the game-killing lag that occurs after a few hours of playing, and after you've reached approximately 500 passengers.  This not only seems to be an issue with the way passengers are grouped for movement, but also a RAM acquisition issue - I've yet to see the game use more than 2GB out of the 16GB I have available for it to run.

There are also issues surrounding the pathing of vehicles, and I have experienced numerous times after re-configuring a side-route that vehicles will stop using the side-route and will only use the main (inital) route.  This of course causes more traffic back-log, more missed flights, and more lag with the even greater mass out-fluxes of passengers from coaches.  

Security.  This needs work too; body scanners are slow, yet the metal detectors either aren't used at all, or passengers go through them twice before proceeding to the gate area.  The barriers that you think would be 1-way, aren't and so passengers will come back out through security, and through ticketing to exit the terminal and go down to the baggage re-claim, even if you've built an internal route for them that's in theory quicker.  

The Café I've yet to see any income from.  Am I missing something, or are the cafe workers also supposed to double as chefs in the kitchen, or is there meant to be a separte worker class of chef??

I have seen some games were people got so demanding and difficult that a lot of times game developers would give up and stop responding, over the two years that I have been playing this game you are still here and doing your upmost best to give what your players want.

To go back and look at the beginning stages of the game where we were met with the bright green screen to the way the game is now has been amazing anyone just has to search YouTube and watch the older videos you will know what I mean. The game since then has had a lot more depth to it and I find it to be challenging to design the right airport that makes the airlines and passengers happy.

There are highs and lows in the changes of the game over time, and sometimes people are quick to judge and dislike the game for it, voice your opinion let them know that you don't like something, explain what you would much rather like to see. I remember a time when they recreated the baggage hub with blue that connects to blue and pink to pink, I used to think what the heck dev's, what are you doing? They listened to the players and gave us something much easier to work with thank you!

Update to the game comes often and  if you are a part of the Edge branch you get to play the new changes to come and test them out, it makes you feel like a part of the team helping to make the game better. If bugs in a game frustrate you I don't recommend joining the edge branch as they are bound to happen.

The developer's are as active as they can be in the discussions to address the problems and to consider ideas for the game. You can tell the love and care that goes into this game when they even play their own game on a live stream and chat with whoever shows up. Looking forward to the next stream.

 I would say this game was a very good buy and considering that is still Early Access, I believe that this game will be outstanding when the project is complete. 

[b]Pros:[/b]
-Build your own style of airport - it lets you become an architect and use different carpeting, build cafes, bathrooms, gates, etc.
-Landings Fees and Terminal Use Fees - Vital in career mode to not go underwater in your project
-Runway Upgrades - Increases your airport interest rate among airlines and lets you serve larger aircraft, which is very creative in my opinion
-Hiring Construction Workers - Not many tycoon games let you hire your own workers, essentially a certain amount of time is alotted for a project to be completed
-Customization of Zones - Whereas you have your pickups and arrivals, you also have garbage and deliveries, making traffic a little pesky but makes the game a lot more organized 
-Devs Quickly Patch and Respond to Complaints - It is very good to see the developers actively engaging with the players and looking at what they can do better and what they need to fix to make the game as best as it can be

[b]Cons:[/b]
-Traffic Jams - Too often do I see busses or cars get stuck on the road and the gridlock will not clear; even if it does not directly affect traffic, it is still annoying
-Taxiway Gridlock - Some airplanes find a way to use the same taxiway at the same time and stop, sometimes stuck there for the whole game, which eliminates the use of the taxiway and costs you the fees associated with the airliners landing/departing/utilizing your airport in addition to the passengers' discontent
-One Level Airports / Lack of Options for Concourses or Multiple Terminals - I know this is probably coming in the future and not to bash an ongoing project, but this should be added

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
I recommend this game to someone that is an aviation enthusiast or a tycoon enthusiast that will wait for the game to be complete and objectively review the game and help the developers with any future ideas.

SimAirport is a game developed and published by LVGameDev LLC. Although this game is still in early access, the game does have some promise

SimAirport has some great concepts with some fun gameplay with a tedious yet entertaining customization to customize the airport of your dreamt and for a basic early access game (in its current state), it kept me playing for hours on end

However, SimAirport in its current state, had a lot of bugs where certain character did not move and stay stuck for no reason. It also happens with cars and transport

The security could improve with their body scanners moving faster rather than clustering up and the game chugs when the frame rate dips when their is a lot of people at the airport

I understand that SimAiport is in at an early stage of develpment and I would like to see new updates soon which the developers have shown that they care about their project

If you can try to add more items in the game that would much appreciated. But in the end, SimAirport is a very nice and enjoyable game

For starters there is no tutorial so you better play around with the game a couple of times until you can understand the basic ins and outs of the game. If you have played games like Prison Architect or Another Brick in the Mall then you will have the basics down pretty well already.
Bugs do pop up every now and then but the developers are quick to sort it out which is a huge plus. Yes the game costs a little too much for an EA game but I guess it balances out with the quick and many updates that happen. As for where the game is development wise, I would of liked to see this game a littler cheaper (£9.99 maybe?).
The Experimental Branch has been fun to play with too, it seems to get the ""updates"" sooner so we can test them out before they go out to everyone, some people have had problems but I have been lucky so far and the Experimental Branch works fine for me (It is called Experimental for a reason).

https://youtu.be/Fu5Nf4zY8Zk

The concept is good, and it is quite enjoyable. So for now I will give it my support as I am really hoping the developers will keep it up and polish this game.

But it seems extremely early access and very buggy, I have had to restart numerous games due to elements bugging out. A lot of the agent pathing is horrible and there are constantly planes or passenger getting into areas they should not be or stuck.

In terms of gameplay it is ok, but really needs to be balanced better. It is way too difficult to get a decent sized airport up and running, even using the max loan you can get it is just not possible. Apart from that it is not too complex, which will be good form some but boring for others.

All in all for the price I think it is good, but it may be worth waiting a while until the game is more polished or released.",1490728701,1491561218

The gameplay is great, in both Career & Sandbox modes. The only problems I have found are the same as the problems others have mentioned. I have had a major framerate problem in sandbox mode, when I tried to create a Mega Airport. Before all 15 gates are occupied (in this case only 4 were occupied) the game seems to keep pausing. 

Hopefully these problems should be solved by the time of full release.

Suggestions for the future :-

                1. The ability to move objects as your airport expands.
                2. Increased loan amounts.
                3. Cargo airport functonality would be great.
                4. Multi level buildings, i.e. the ability to have outbound passengers on one level and     inbound on another.
                5. Wider range of aircraft.
                6. Retail/Duty free zone would help boost profits

I would like to preface this review by saying, the devs are very very responsive and are working very hard on getting bugfixes and updates out. They do listen to the community, and this does not seem like a studio that will do the whole alpha and abandon.

Gameplay and Mechanics: 5/10 - It is a lot of fun to build the different zones in your airport and continue developing terminals, gates and upgrades as your airport grows. Now, that being said, end game comes way too quick. Within maybe 2-3 hours on a save, my airport was making 500k+ a day, and I had run out of things to put in. Now with this being a very early alpha, it is understandable that there are some lacking features. However in its current state, there really isn't much to do. 

The core unlocks and gameplay is way too easy. Customer satisfaction is always high, even with low amounts of facilities. The airline contracts come way too easy, and there isn't (a visible one anyway) any kind of relationship status with the airlines. Sure they will cancel on you for some reason, but I can't see a way how to check why. It is frustrating to lose 20k in termination fees and not really see how to improve. Many times you're only losing contracts due to game breaking bugs which will be discussed further in the review.

In its current state, the gameplay here is really fix the default airport by adding facilities and staff until you have 3-4 gates going and its endgame. You can't even use all of the features the game has due to bugs, such as the restriction of food court/cafe right now.

Bugs: The game is broken in many many ways. Simple things just dont work. I.E Food court. But there are also smaller bugs such as passangers blobbing at the end of queues and getting stuck, causing bottlenecks. Construction also creates weird zones (with secure/nonsecure zones) sometimes and requires reloading to fix. 

The real game breaking bugs are the ones that I cannot see workarounds to. Such as gates being available and flights being cancelled because the game does not register it. So you end up scheduling flights 3-4 hours apart and still have issues sometimes. Or traffic on the roads. Why does a bus carrying passangers stop blocking both lanes of traffic to drop them off when he could just block one. Also, why does a garbage truck take 3-4 hours to pickup trash? Seems silly.

All bugs aside, there is the huge lag issue. I have a gtx 980, and a new gen I7 paired with 16 gigs of ram. Aaand its on a SSD drive. So there is absolutely no reason this game should be running at less than 10 FPS when I have 2 747 class airplanes, and 2 767's at the same time. So theres that.",1490590359,1490590359

Planes getting stuck in the grass because you have destroyed the runway to move it to a better location ( this bug blocks off ALL access to the gate so NO plane can use it) ...this became so troublesome that I was not meating flights because the said gate becomes in essence dead and the smaller planes were using my XL gate so that the large planes were no longer landing.

The road system is honestly a disaster. I get needing to research a double road but the garbage can kill your game.

It is fun building and if the developer continue their effort it can be good concurrent for airport ceo game, also in development. 

In the first early release routing the traffic was a real nightmare when your airport grew. People get clogged up at the bus stops and eventually your peeps will miss their outbound flights or flights are delayed because your security cannot coop with the demand. The routing has been improved, and that bring me to a major advantage of the game. The developer really look at bug reports and update the game very often. 

The game itself is very playable and integrated with steam workshop these days. This way you can share your airport with other people playing it. 

However a fair warning, the game is under development. Once you're going for a grand airport with many in and outbound flights the game might get slow and sluggy as many peeps need to navigate through the airport. On my low end pc the game would almost be unplayable. 

I would like to suggest to (let the player) put a fire-regulation in place, allowing only x amount of peeps in your terminal. This would off-course limit the size of the airport, but also make it a challenge to make the airport run a smootly as possible.

That being said, the game does have bugs. They are being worked out, but if you are looking for a finished early access game then you don't know what you are looking for. 

The game as it is, is fun. The airport that you start with is capable of almost handling contracts immediately and you start with a large chunk of cash. I found it difficult to turn a profit early on which makes the game go from a speeding bullet of building and hiring to a slow crawl of waiting for money to come in. To be far, the game will still be smoothed out.

The price tag may be a bit high, but it weeds out the people who are not really interested in helping the developer out by reporting bugs, glitches or difficult gameplay. That makes the SimAirport community  a great one and one I'm glad to be a part of.

There are many bugs, granted this is an Early Access Game so I'm sure they will be removed before the final release (None of them are too game breaking).
It can be a little repetitive after a few airports, there is nothing (yet) that really creates unique scenarios so it can feel like a build and watch game.
The price right now ($19.99) seems a little high but I'm sure once more updates are released I'll retract that statement.

Overall: If you don't mind the bugs and enjoy watching your airport work I recommend this game. If you're unsure I suggest you wait a month and watch this game develop. It's great in it's current form (for me) and will definitely be worth the $19.99 once a few updates and patches come out.",1490223360,1490223360

The general game is fantastic, there's just enough to manage to keep you going for a while.
Over time I hope they add a LOT more as you can get fully setup in no time, if you know what you're doing.

BUT, if you're an experianced player you can get setup and making a TON of money in no time, and be left with little to nothing to do...... If I could get to that stage...

My current save is un-playable. 5 small gates and 3 XL gates, with planes and passengers breaks the game.

Anything over 1500 passengers at one time, anywhere on the map, and the game runs at 1 FPS with CPU usage at 100%.
My chips is set to 4.1GHZ and it's using ALL of it. x5 speed is more like 1/2 speed when it's lagging, it's frustrating!

Due to this I can't play past the point of a few gates as the game becomes un-playable.

Until this issue is fixed I have to either start a new save every day, or limit the amount of planes I have coming in at one time. As for Cafe's... Good luck with that... It's massively broken. 

I ended up having to plan what planes came and went so my game would run, not because of airport space. In the end I could only have 2 small planes and 1 XL plane before the lag hit, HARD. Which left me disapointed as I have 5 gates and 3 runways not in use, and 5,000,000 sitting in the bank.

I cannot wait for the update to fix this so I can finally open up all gates, fill my schedule and run the game the way it was design. 

Until then, I'm stuck playing small maps, with limited passengers, and hardly any planes.

Longer version bellow.

As I mentioned above, the game mimics more or less popular titles like ""Prison Architect"" (just look at it: the same graphics, the same road (only this time it's on the left of the map!), the same concept of delivery zones, etc) and ""Airport tycoon"" (the concept in general).
Unfortunately, it fails to provide you a real challenge or at least anything fun to do. The number of zone types is very limited, the number of objects is very limited, and the only way of dealing with the increasing number of passengers is just to build/expand those zone and jam them up with more objects like body scanners. How fun.

Now, ""Prison Architect"" gave you an immensely deep game with a lot of things to monitor and manage. ""Airport tycoon"" let you go behind the registration counter and actually manage every aspect of your airport. This game does neither.

P.S.
I almost forgot! Let's say you've found the inner strength and built a huge airport... say hello to constant freezes then! Yay!",1490074930,1490075111

Don't be proud of yourself for fixing numerous bugs every day; it supposed to be done before releasing even it's the early access. It cannot be happened in the gaming history once again.

The AI thing is stupid; there is no reason to put more ""things"" for the characters since they go to the closest thing from them.

1. the traffic AI is maddening after you add more then one lane it tends to pull across all the lanes and completly block traffic
2. the passenger AI if you dont have enough vending machines for the amount of passengers that you get through your airport atleast for me all the passengers would get in line for the vending machines and miss there flight because the line got so long

Mike, since this review I processed for a refund, but have been avidally keeping up to date with the game. Undeniably, the dev/s are doing an amazing job providing regular updates to the game, already fixing (or on their way to fixing) things that really ruined the experience (like not being able to assign flights to specific gates). That is the nature of early access and from that front the dev/s comittment is really nice to see.

Whether I know game design or not, I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels that there's early access and 'early access' (where the former is a diamond in the rough with some issues, and the latter is something that has fundamental flaws and is basically unplayable - a money grab). Upon its release, I would say SimAirport sat somewhere uncomfortably between the two. It was playable, but had fundamental flaws, and at the time (and still does to some degree) lack a large amount of content or depth to make the game truly replayable. I'm sure there are people gagging for a game like this and are willing to pay just to get early access. I'm not one of them. I'm willing to support a game, especially one that has commited developers like this one, but I don't buy something purely based off commitment or what will be. I take into account the current state of the game.

As someone who likes the idea of the game, but could also be fine without it, I would say ~£20 is a little steep. I'm confident that the majority of negative reviews for this game are not about it's playability but infact that for the state the game was in when they purchased it, the price is pretty extornionate. Everyone has an idea of value that is their own. You may see the potential this game has, as well as there being no other alternative as good reason to spend £20, there are many like you from a glance of the steam reviews. But equally, I see that while the game has potential, if I were to buy it now, it's currently not worth anywhere near £20 in my opinion, and similarly from reading the steam reviews I can see many that share my view. This is why I discussed other early access games charging less at the start, that way they can appeal to both you and I. While they are getting more money from people like you (assuming you are like that), they're losing out more on people like me. Who know's what price is the 'right' price, the best blend so to speak.

None-the-less, with the rate the game is improving I can see myself slowly starting to justify the current price, but just not yet, there's still some way to go.


Original review:

Right, I'm going to reflect the same opinions of many other critical reviews, but here goes.

The game has an interesting concept, and generally executes what has been implemented quite well. Unfortunately, as of writing this review, very little of the game seems actually present (or at least I hope that's the case). In my playtime (2-3 hours), I accomplished most of what the game had to offer. Currently this game has very little replayability value. The game also has quite a few incredibly distracting bugs, and occasionally crashes.

All this would probably be fine, if it wasn't for the fact that the developers are asking the full game price despite the games current state with both lack of content and strong presence of bugs. Early access isn't a banner you can hide behind and say ""Well, it's early access, so of course it's broken"" or ""Well, it's early access, so of course there's very little to do"" while still justifying full price. I've bought games in the past, such as Minecraft and KSP when they were in their early access (/pre-release phases). I think both cost around £7, which is easily half the price of the full release version if not less. And yet, compatively, even in their state at the time of purchase, they were far more complete than SimAirport is.

And that's really it. The game isn't a bad premise (although I am aware it's not the only game meant to be coming out in this genre), but at the moment, it's buggy... with little content... at full price.

I can't help but feel that the 'greed' of the developers will actually backfire. I'm sure they would have more takers if they price the game appropriately, in turn, they'll recieve more feedback, and the customers would be happier and not feel completely ripped off. I would geniunely struggle to justfiy spending £10 on this game at the moment, and they're asking for almost double that, pffft.",1490054496,1490643640

The games seems rushed. You can clearly recognize the influence of Prison Architect, only the graphics are clearly unfinished and a lot of features are still missing. Having said that, those features that ARE implemented seem to work pretty well, I experienced no crashes in the 1,5 - 2 hours that I played, although I did have some issues with a/c getting stuck on the gate and requiring a manual ""release"" to get them going again. Unfortunately, if you miss this the stuck a/c ends up blocking your entire schedule with disasterous effects. 

Is the game worth $20? I would say ""No, not yet"". The game certainly has potential, but based on what I've seen, there's still a [b]LONG[\b] way to go. Maybe wait with purchasing to see how it develops. At the very least, the graphics need to become a bit less bright 'n colourful (if you're going to copy PA, why not also the graphics style?).

I really like this game and it does have great potential! But there are a few things i would like to adress:
- At my airport the people keep waiting outside the door, and mis their flights because of this. (Don't know if it's a bug or something I did wrong....)
- In the upcoming ideas you stated that you would like staff that works in pieces of the day, and not like now, the whole day. I personally think this would really downgrade the whole experience.
- People don´t go trough security on the way out, I don´t like this idea because it really isn´t realistic and secure areas are really hard to maintain with (my) current ideas for buildings.

Also I did encounter some difficulties when loading my game after a update, I think that something like that is unprofessional.

BUGS: I have yet to experience a game-breaking bug, though I haven't tested the Cafe yet (which many people complain that it can seriously create havoc in your game and have to start over). Yes, you do get people/vehicles stuck, but you can continue playing if you don't mind seeing that odd baggage cart stuck on the tarmac.

LAGGING: I try to avoid scheduling big aircraft to avoid the lagging. V-SYNC has helped alot (on ADM, open Vision Control centre, go to Gaming, then to 3D Application Settings and scroll down to ""wait for vertical refresh""). I can easily handle 1.000 people. Reloading the game every now and then also seems to help quite alot. Then again I have a pretty good machine. Avoid if your computer is not up for it. This is definitely an area they need to work heavily on. People want to build big airports. You should be able to handle 5.000 passengers even on a descent (not great or even good) PC.

CONTENT: There isn't much content yet, so no, you won't be able to recreate Dubai or LHR with shops, restaurants, underground and overground transport, garages, etc. No shops, for example (apart from the Cafe). Scheduling is very very basic (the Timetable is where, i believe, most people will spend their time and needs major changes). You don't even see where the Aircraft come from or go to.

PRICE: 22EUR is quite alot. Should have been around 15EUR. 


Although I ticked the ""yes"" box, my recommendation is to wait as there is another airport game coming out soon.

A lot of the bad reviews seem to stem from people forgetting the idea that this game is early access. However, this is probably one of the most intriguing games I've seen for a while. Buyers beware, at this stage you are not getting a complete game....YET! Yes it may not be complete but it definitely is a fun game to play at this stage. Here are some more specifics into it:


Likes: 

1. As far as managing, you have a lot of different ways to control your airport.

2. Fairly realistic, I am an aviation enthusiast and granted there are some unrealistic things about this game but overall, especially with the background ATC chatter and the airport equipment, I am pretty happy with the current result. 

3. Developers are ACTIVE. SimAirport is receiving updates monthly if not weekly. The developers have listened to the community, and are working their way to the finished product. 

4. A lot of different aspects of the airport. Everything from security to the baggage conveyors to a separate café. The airport is intricate. 


Dislikes:


Once again this is an early access so most of these I overlook. However, you may experience these issues. 


1. AI bugs. Lots of bugs with the AI. In the current stage of my airport the AI will get ""stuck."" Now once again, we are expecting this to be fixed in the near future so stay tuned. 

2. Frame rates and stability are not great. Running 10x speed with 3,000 moving objects in the airport does take a toll on your computer. So be aware of this aspect when it comes to the game. 

3. Scheduling isn't the best. Out of all the things, the aircraft are set to arrive at a certain time and you can almost guarantee the busier the airport gets, there's going to be a delay for any larger airlines. Especially those 747s and the A380s. 


Overall I do suggest this game. However, for those who are on edge and don't want to commit now, I would suggest maybe waiting a little more to see more of those features come out. I am happy with the current game and I am looking forward to see what it brings in the future. Hope you guys enjoyed this review!

I am enjoying the little bit we have now to play around with, and I am certain there will be more to enjoy with each update that is released. I am not going to knock the game for having bugs or crashes, or having things that simply dont' work (at the time of this review, Cafes don't work properly - which is going to change). The only thing I will knock about the game is the price, even then it is hard to criticize the price because I know at some point here in the near future, there will be enough content that merits it. 

If you enjoy games like this, and want to help the Dev team out, pick it up. If you are patient, willing to deal with crashes, bugs, and the like, pick it up. Even though there is not much to do yet, there is enough to keep me playing. And as things get added, taken away, expanded upon, improved upon...that is oinly going to increase the amount of time I give this game. 

The graphics aren't the best, and they don't have to be. I know some people have compared SimAirport to Airport CEO, which are similar in a lot of ways, but also vastly different. This game has potential, it has a lot of things going for it that makes me believe it will be an asbolute pleasure to play once it is completely finished. But I am not going to wait until the end product to enjoy it, oh no no. I am going to be there every update, sending feedback, and watching the game grow into its' own. 

I know this hasn't been much of a review, but that's because this game is going to change, which means my review about the current state of the game won't mean much a week, a month, or two months down the line. So either pick up the game, enjoy the little content and help the Dev team by sending feedback; or wait until it is done. Either way, have a safe flight.",1489963120,1489963120

The reason I want to write a review is cos I have been impressed with the devs to realease regular patches and are also very responsove to bug queries. 
This is an early access game and my whole point to this review is that I want to support the devs in a game that has a huge potential. I love sim games and there has forever been a huge gap in the market in airport sims games. There have been a fair few of them that have failed miserably. This is the first one in many many years that has a lot of potetntial. Yes there are a huge amount of bugs and sometimes renders the game unplayable at times but that is not why I purchased an 'early access' game. I know what this game can be and with the devs being very active with the community then I am happy to support their concept. 
This will be a great game when released. My advise is only purchase this is you have patience and understand this is still being developed so the customers end of the bargain is to report the bugs which are getting fixed on a regular basis and to support these kind of developers and understand the bigger picture of what this game is going to become BUT only if the developers hold up their end of the bargain and to continually patch and be active in the community. 

The actual game itsef is great fun (bugs excluded) if you love sim games then this is for you. It has a 'prison architect' feel about it and 'theme park' feel to it. I have been waiting for this type of game to be relaesed for a while and cannot wait until final release.",1489895273,1489895273

i dont know if any of these have been fixed in todays patch but...

1. my agents and food worker disapear from there stations rom time to time. its like they go on a lunch break. security are the only ones who stay at there jobs. and it will only let me hire one, of the CFO or CEO. wont let me have both. and the one i do hire stays at the door to there office. they dont go in.

2. i hired 3 food workers to try to get them to take care of the people faster but only one gets the food. i figured one to stay at the register and 2 serving food. maybe i need more cash registers. i will try that today.

3. im surprised this game doesnt have a tab where you can see what your airport is making in terms of money and expenses. it does but not in the dep that i hoped. how much is your food court making in a day? ATM, vending machines, etc... maybe a day by day log. how do i know if the additions i made are bringing in more people? making me more money than before. IMO thats one of the best parts of these tycoon type games. the stats. 

4. maybe a tutorial? i would love to see how you run the underground conver belt with the baggage. maybe then i wouldnt loose a agent to drive the golf cart with baggage.  and is anyone else having problems upgrading there runways to lights? i have the money, put it over it like they say but it wont do anything.. maybe a bug ?

5. i know this is a univeral game , but maybe you can add campains with cities. NY, Paris, etc... this way you can know where your planes are going and coming from. maybe add a map of the world so you could see where they are in real time. probably would have been better if we could own the planes and judging by the type of plane and the distance it could travel we could send it to certain cities . and maybe then we could have seperate wings of our airport for domestic and international.

6. and im surprised there is no gift shop, or duty free shop. 

tons of potential, this game could really be great if the devolopers want to keep adding to it. i still like it. so in hope that they continue to upgrade and fix the bugs i will say yes to buying it.",1489762264,1489762264

76561197991237496,598330,True,0,0,0,15843,2731,108,6,"Firstly i want to say this game is early access. What does that mean? It means the developers have said we have this idea, we have a game and we want to share it with you. Its not finished, its not ready, but we are excited about this game and we want you to be apart of it. 
SimAirport is exactly that, its a fantastic idea for a great game and the guys are so keen on it they wanted to share it with us. Its not finished, sure, so if you are looking for a finished game this is not for you. (Though after todays patch 17/3/2017 it really is very stable). However the idea behind early access is for you to take part in the development of the game, help find the bugs, make suggestions and get involved in the process... in essence, become the developer yourself!

This game had a lot of bugs in the early days sure, but half the fun was trying to figure out what those bugs were, make a save, send it the dev's telling them whats going on so they can address it. I've seen a lot of early access games since the term was coined and i have been shattered by some developers, But SimAirport is not one of those games. These guys have been active in development and in the community every day. They talk with us and they work with us and ultimatly get through the bugs. They are listening to us the community and adding the things we suggest, This is the epitome  of what early access is all about!

So although its nice to feel like you are part of the game, there is nothing like knowing you helped make the game what it is.

In that instance, this is the perfect game. 

The game itself is a classic Tycoon game in every sence, I know a lot of games have carried the title but very few have stood up to the classics like theme hospital, themepark tycoon or even the granddaddy Transport tycoon. But this game does, it harkens back to those classic's like very few have and even in this raw and early state it is a far better game then a lot of those developed by large software companies. This game has a soul and i can not recommend it enough. 

So don't wait, dont miss out on this community, get into it, be apart of it and if you do i dont think you will regret it :)

I have a 9 month old macbook pro with 16GB memory and this game still lags even with graphics but down to its lowest setting. i look at the the state of the mac whilst playing sim airport and the game only uses up a small fraction on the laptops performance. so not sure whats going on there. 

-another point is the buid menu, it could be set out more clearly such as the objects menu?

-shops could be added?

- the resturaunt idea could be imporved, maybe coming as one big block?

-if you could build some sort of invisabe one way wall so that passengers dont go where you dont want them too.

Like some other comments mention, ifyou have ever played Prison Architect, you will know how to generally play this game,
because it feels very similar to it in the way everything works, yet it is a completely different experience.

So, after 7.8 hours played, 7.5 if not including the afk times, I can stay that I would recommend this game, though
you should wait for a sale to get it, I have explored everything in the game, yet not in detail, and can tell I will have to spend many more hours to fully understand every concept in the game, leaving for many play hours. So:

You start the game, it immidiatly throws you into it, ou see your littlebuilding, with security, and one gate, and it all starts there, as you start to make your daily schedule and hire more airlines you can start expanding your airpot, as you expand gates, you expand ticketing, then security, you can even make a baggage system, sadly the game does not have extremely much content yet, you can expand for a while, you start making a cafe, lounge area, and then, you finally get the ""big boy"" airlines to offer you a contract, you accept a flight and see it come in your new Extra large Gate, an Airbus A380, as it lands you see the message come in ""Flight 12979 25,000$ Terminall Use"" and thats when the game really kicks off, more money, bigger planes, and TONS of new Passengers, 450, on a single plane. 

And from there on, you can keep expanding, making more gates, and hiring more planes, then, it gets king of boring, since it is an Early Acces Game,I expected for it to not have a huge amount of content, though it really is little, this, and the countless Bugs are the only cons I have found about this game, so far, though, I'm sure they will addmore content, I also have a few suggestions:

Making your own ""Airline"" - and I dont specifically mean Airline, but to make your own flights, and maybe other players with internet connection could receive them at their airport, and so on, since there is already a hangar mechanic in the game I wouldn't expect this to be horribly difficult, though current hangars are only vehicles.

More In Depth Business , etc. - If you have ever been to an airport, you should know the countless number of different shops and stores everywhere, the only option as of now, is a cafe, which did somewhat dissapoint me, and with only one cafe, all passengers get stuck there in line, and dont make their flight, so more shops and stores would be nice.

[h1]Long Version:[/h1]
This Game reminds me of other ""Big Players"" of Indi-Games like [b][i]Prison Architect[/i][/b] or the [b][i]Pre-Alpha of Rimworld[/i][/b], and not just because of the similar graphics-style.


The concept and topic of the game itself looks very promising. Its a fresh thing and feels a bit like a Rolercoaster-Similation with all the feeding of Passengers and the waste they left inside the terminal-building.

The ""technical"" Part of the Game at the current Version [i](15th Mar 2017)[/i] is working as a raw, pure Alpha and needs a lot of polishing, more Content and even more confort.
BUT it is working, and it does what it has to do - Passengers have a comprehensible a behaviour, use all the currently available Items and [i](beside of some Pathfinding-issues)[/i] it looks great if a big Plane ""unleashes"" a lot of little pawns into your Terminal.

Admittedly I was pushing the game to its limits at first with around 25/30 builders, As soon as I put them to work the game becomes unplayable until they finish what they're doing. As a side note I had the graphical settings set to ' Best' which I then changed to Fastest. Which didn't seem to have any effect on performance whatsoever.

I can understand their disclaimer at the start that tells you NOT to use the 'Start From Scratch' option that is available.
Demolishing and rebuild is definitely not a recomendation but in the interests of testing I wanted to see what it could handle at this point.

As a bit of a benchmark I then fired all but 5 of my builders and still had the same issue, there is some major work needed on the optimisation front. I feel like the actual employee sprites (especially the buiders) could be less detailed which may improve the performance. Hoever I am not a developer nor do I understand game engines but considering it look no better than Prison Architect I can easily say that Prison Architect was in a MUCH better state at the same time in release of Early Alpha (I had EA of that too from Kickstarter).

On the whole a nice game with massive potential, quirky style and generally quite promising. There are plenty of features I would like to see added and a lot of what already exists I would like to see adapted to work slightly differently.

It is by no means close to being a stable, complete game in it's current form.  The game has bugs that need fixing and it definitely feels like the developer released the game in it's current state to get the needed play testers required to discover all the bugs. With that said, I appreciate that the development team is active in the discussion boards and seems dedicated to communicate with those experiencing issues.  Patches have been released at a steady clip and I'm confident that in a week or two, many of the game breaking bugs will be worked out.

------------------------------
so normally i wouldnt reccomend a game with this many bugs, autosave seems to freeze the game for up to a minute and even crash the game all together, while saving the game normally works fine, the ais arent to smart, theyll all pick the same few lines for everything even if you have 30 open (this can be fixed a little bit by setting certian desks to only take first class or only take business/ coach, but theyll still do the same thing on a smaller scale), hundreds of people will crowd around one snack vending machine (agian regardless of how many you have available theyll almost always go to the same one) and even miss their flights to get a candy bar out of them, the workers are incompetent sometimes and id probably fire them all in real life, they often like to stand around even when theres loads of stuff to do, i just got out of playing and had hundreds of people miss a flight because the person that was supposed to be letting passengers on and checking tickets was just standing beside another desk that was already occupied doing nothing. HOWEVER the devs are patching bugs like crazy, it seems like its every couple of nights or so (EDIT: I just checked and its literally every night), so as long as they keep that up i can forgive the bugs a little bit, overall it seems like it will be a good game once they get the bugs ironed out, a few suggestions for the devs:
-parking lots/ garages and car rentals to make extra money
    -dedicated taxi cab lots (maybe these increase income or hapiness (i dont really know how they work irl, but most decent sized airports have them))
-more specific types of staff (so if i want one person to be dedicated to taking tickets and letting people on the plane they wont go off and get baggage off the plane instead, you could also implement a system to assign a certian desk to a certian employee, then that desk can only be used by that employee)
-those little fence things that go around queues
-windows that increase hapiness a tiny bit (i know its all top down and you cant see the sides but it annoys me that my airport is a white box with some doors on it
-expandable land

- Passengers not using some ticketing desks or security checks
- Airplanes lagging on the tarmac and not leaving/arriving at all
- Passengers freezing around the airport and outside the airport

And the biggest of them all currently:

- Having V-Sync on can completely fuck up your game so remember to turn it off if you are having FPS problems. The setting somehow stuffs up your CPU usage so disabling V-sync can greatly improve your FPS. For me my fps jumped from ~8 to ~60 during peak time after turning off the V-sync setting (I am using an i5-6500).

These are the only ones that currently piss me off the most, but don't let the bugs fool you; the idea behind this game is nice and it has been updated almost every day with bug fixes and such so I bet this game will be an indie game gem after a few weeks or patching.

Here is some points I highly enjoy:

+ The sandbox mode is amazingly fun if you just want to make an huge airport and test your scheduling skills
+ The game has fun and bright look to it even though the graphics are not that great or even important
+ The amount of different aircraft to have at your airport is decent and seeing multiple different models rolling around your airport really gives this game a nice touch of diversity

P.S. 

As an aircraft-nerd the fact that Boeing 777 uses a smaller gate than B787 while being a larger plane in real life and that there is a B707 in the game along with the most modern jets slightly infriates me. Nothing major if you don't know exact aircraft models though.",1489412720,1489412789

I think that in a week or two most of the minor bugs will be gone, and within two months almost all of the major bugs will be gone. You can tell that the developers are working hard on fixing the bugs, because they are realising a new patch almost every day fixing the bugs.  After all the game came out not very long ago, so it is bound to have a bunch of bugs. 

I think that the devs will add a bunch of objects and game mecanics in the months and years to come.  I see people complaing about how the game is in an unplayable state, but i think the exact opasit. Shure it has a lot of major bugs, but if you look at the patch posts you can see that the devs have implemented temperary fixes for the major issue.

If the player likes and has the game Prison Architect this game has a very simalar feel to if. Just instead of Building a prison you build a airport. One of my favorite mecanics is the Delay/Cancil system, although it might need some work. This is my favorite mechanic because it imitates the real world how planes won't always arrive at the same time every day.

Some things that I think that the devs could add to the game are things for GA (General Avation) airports . These would include:

Dirt/Grass Runways and Taxiways 
Hangers for Airplanes ( that airlines could rent)
Small/ Medium Gates ( Like gates that dont have Jetways)
Cargo Capibilities ( Not Really GA but what ever)


Over all i think that SimAirport is a great buy. It my be a little expencive at $20 (in the US) , But it shows amazing potential.

This game is like Prision Architect but in aviation format for us AV geeks out there but also for the general gamer that wants to chill back and just game. 
This game will test your nerves a little with maintaining a airport aswell as finance, so there is a lot of decision making and calculating to make sure you don't go into debt and go into the red.

Here is a list of pros and cons with the game so far.

PROS
- Enable and fun to play
- Passes time 
- Running your own airport
- Intresting
- Great Dev team
Bring out at least 2/3 patch fixes daily to make this game more stable.
- No FPS loss when tabing in and out of game.

CONS
- FPS hit when loads of passengers in terminal. (They are aware of this)
- Bugs will occur when you don't expect them.

Would I recommend?
Yes and No 
Yes, as it is fun an enjoyable and something to pass time or just to play while you think of a game your in the mood to play.
No, still pretty buggy but like every early game you get them but the best thing is you can report it and the Dev will try and fix it in the next patch which is a bonus 

If you want to get this game but are aware you will experience bugs I will deco recommend even at the price 

Rating?

Update: 
After playing a bit more, I've given up, the bugs in the game at the moment, makes it unplayable. 

- AI is REALLY bad, flat out, people get stuck in walls and objects.
- If there's two places in a toilet that has got ""dirty"" floor, and a janitor goes to clean up,
he cleans one floor, then proceeds to clean somewhere else, instead of cleaning the nearest dirt.
- People miss flights even though there's no queues.
- People missing flights, will still check through security, only to go home right after
- People loop around the metal detectors.
- If you place queues for the Gate check in, the flights can get delayed by up to 60+ minutes.
In aviation that kind of delay would almost certainly cancel an entire flight.
- Cafe's are entirely broken and makes everyone stuck in the cafe.
- The economy needs looked at, the amount of staff and objects you need to be able to serve a single Boeing 707 for instance, is way too expensive compared to the income from the flight.
- If you decide to build a foundation, then cancel it, to adjust, you cant build another foundation in the same area ever again, cause it'll be blocked by ""Construction in progress"" or something to that effect.
- If you place build walls, then later demolish them, they get removed and you've got grass, and it's treated as ""outside""
- The security exit, meant for arriving passengers to leave through, doesn't work.

I like the game and what it can be, but in its current state, I can't recommend it, I may be harsh seeing as it's an early access and alpha, but at the price it's sat at now €22, these bugs shouldn't be here, the real price should've been €9,99 maybe even as low as €4,99

I wanted this game to be perfect so bad, There is so much potential and even after the first 5 minutes you can see that this will be a good game but it is so buggy at the moment. An airport management game is the one tycoon game i have been missing. I love the fact you can decide what flights come in and when. I love the fact you can even have conveyor belts for luggage and i especially love the fact that there are secure areas just like a real airport but after some time i realised the game just isnt worth bothering with until some serious updates are rolled out. One thing that is irritating me so much is the fact i can't save my game. I was able to save it when i just got started but now i have put some time and thought into it, the game refuses to save. (Saving constantly then nothing)

The AI needs some serious work, Getting stuck on walls, Vehicles and just never leaving the airport. This game could and probably will be worth the money they are asking for but right now there is no point. Its games like this that make me hate Early Access.

Constant rolling of patches and bug fixes, a lot of major gamebraking bugs (Stucked Garbage trucks, Stucked passenger, Crashes for e.g.) are already fixed or at least reduced to an amount which isn't gamebraking.

Having worked at one of the busiest airports in the world (by traffic), I can say without hesitation, that SimAirport is as accurate as you will get to an actual operating airport – I say this now – as I can only imagine how the game will progress in the next few months.  I have been totaled impressed by the game thus far and as I continue to understand it and get a feel around the UI I find it fun, amusing, and very addictive.

You start out with some basic features, all though you can select a sandbox mode or even select to have a cleared play area to start with.  I have not tried starting from the ground up, all though I did load a map to see what was there.  The first thing to do is set your ques and assign them to your counters, security line, and gates.  This needs a little more work – as its not intuitive enough without some explanation as to how to assign, etc.  Once this happens you can go in and start adding flights – I would strongly suggest smaller A/C first (Beechcraft or RJ’s) until you get everything up and running.  I would also suggest you separate your inbound security lines with your outbound passengers.  This will help the flow of passengers coming into the departure hall.

Overall I am truly impressed by the game and hope to see the developer continue patching and making improvements.  I am willing to help if they are interested – so reach out if you are!  I will reserve a full review until a little later once several patches are added.

One note:  Please add a way to adjust the map with buttons on the mouse as well as edge scrolling (which seems to not work as fluid as it could).

The game has some pretty severe bugs, game breaking bugs in fact. The toons will all crowd around ticket booths or security check areas, and never leave, and I mean NEVER. Their flight will have left 2 days earlier, but there they stand, waiting in line to get their bags checked or whatever. The cafe/kitchen setup is a mess too. Toons all crowd around to order food, but just cause a huge disaster area that is impossible to clean up. I had 8 kitchen staff that I fired, that also just stood around, refusing to leave the premises.

The planes have gotten stuck in the loading area for me a couple times too, though it could have been because of weather? I actually don't know the reason for the plane, as there is very little information given in game for things like that.

The game is very basic in some aspects, but VERY deep in many others. Because of this latter aspect, I think this could be a very cool game someday.

Review Updated 3rd April 2017

This game is flaunt with bugs. Passengers getting stuck, passengers going through aircraft gates to get to the other side of my airport, passengers going outside through taxiways for a quicker route to the dropoffs and this is to list a few. The game gets laggy with over 400 passengers, not to mention the fact that building foundations is difficult to master, as walls can turn up anywhere where you don't want them.

However, there is a positive. This game has a stunning idea, and the concept is amazing. The game at the moment has a lot of potential, I can see myself buying this game again in the very future. SimAirport can be the very successor to Airport Tycoon and I can see this happening, but before this the bugs need to be sorted.

The game is still very early access and needs a lot of work to become good. It is quite buggy and lacks balance and features. I am however rating it up because of the potential.

Longer version:
Well then, I don't really know where to start with this review..

This game definitely has a lot going for it. I have been looking for a new tycoon game like this for a while, and this is the most promising out of the ones I have seen (hence I decided to buy it). However, the game is still in VERY very early access. Customers constantly get stuck on objects and corners. Baggage belts dont display the baggage correctly. 30 minutes into the game, the fps drops to hell, even though my PC should be able to handle this game nay day.

Currently, there is also very little progression in the game. There is very little to unlock, and to be honest, very little to do in general. Building is expensive, which discourages expansion. On my very first airtport, customers got pissed cus security was too slow, however, I could not expand my security since I didn't have money. This results in playing the waiting game, more often than not.

Other than that, the game is still quite buggy like I mentioned earlier. Customers gettings stuck and clumping up randomly is very strange.. A way to control the anount of customers you let in would be very handy. You can select how many customers come in by choosing the planes by capacity, however, the balance is way off. You need more planes to get more money, but you end up flooding your airport which ends up in customers getting too angry and leaving. 

This game has a lot of potential, however, I would hold up on buying this just yet.",1489077572,1489077615

09/04/2017 - Yet to play the latest update, but it seems developers are running dry on daily or once/daily, let alone weekly updates, last one being 8 days ago... Are we finally done with game breaking issues and working on new features? I'll play it tomorrow and check it out!

17/03/2017 - 5 Part update in comments. 7 more days and the game might be in shape it ought to have been on release, bug-wise.

16/03/2017 update based on comments, in addition to sort-of direct responses to the coments themselves in the comment secion.

Whether the EA was released at this point to be first-out-of-the-gate upcoming Airport Simulator title, whether it was based on the huge popularity the greenlight campaign has received or whether it's the upcoming Steam EA changes which prompted the, in my mind, premature Early Release, it does not really mater. As mentioned time and again before - I am a supported of early access games - as they get the game in our hands sooner rather than later - without a full set of features developer intented to release.

I cannot help myself, but involuntarily equate this release to the recently published 45 minute play-through of the Airport CEO. Yes, I know - it's unfair to compare the two, and I was avoiding making a comparison for a long time, because they serve different 'markets' - SimAirport is the sort-of equivalent of Lemonade Stand Tycoon or whatever it was called - Ok graphics, Ok simulation, lack of depth sort of thing. Aiport CEO aims for a different demographics - Ok graphics coupled with deep simulation. The only reason I'm bringin this up, as mentioned before - is that they did a play-through. Part 1 of 3 actually. So I can know that they really played their own game for sustained period of time. I did not see any of such videos from SimAirport. While they, and I believe, thruthully, claim that this game is their baby, I did not see them making sure 'the baby is carried to term' - I see them, and let's see how far I can stretch this metaphor, as delivering the infant and putting him in the public education and seeing if they can nurture him to health and make him a model citizen instead.

And for everyone comparing Sim Airport to Prison Architect - I can show you countless other games, released before PA, which share similar isometric 2D style. PA did not invent it - such style is ideal for strategy games.

While it is never my intention to question Indie developers love of their own title, nor would I have the reason to, especially since the devs do show great attention and responsiveness, the timing of the release remains the biggest question mark which developers are yet to address. To LVGameDev in particular, while I do appreciate you took the time to spend 20 minutes in crafting a reply to my forum post, albeit deciding to trash it, and focusing on 'righting the wrongs' as opposed to 'shocking and awing' me - this question mark still linguers. 

But hey ho - I have a few days off and I'll try to dive into the game again to check the progress - while 7 days is nothing major in game development timeline, I am eager to see how many and how well of the earliest reported bugs are fixed. My 5 minute gameplay, as screenshotted above, is yet to inspire confidence.

Original review:

From the forum post:

To the lovely and responsive developers - you keep saying you are relying on the community to build an amazing airport sim. That's great!

From your Steam description text '[...]but be aware, eventually you'll probably encounter a bug or two.'. Yeah... I must ask though, how much of the game you played yourselves? I am a web systems developer and I know you can't test everything. But, for example, in your promo video, people were not getting stuck anywhere - was it genuine gameplay or scripted mechanics? Or was it just recorded with one small aircraft in the schedule?

The general point being - there are early accesses and then there are early accesses - but come on - though I am an early access supporter, and I might have 'unreasonable' expectactations, I do expect an EA release where it is at the very least playable and enjoyable state, taking into account restrictions of content implied by EA.

So I must ask honestly - how much was the release date was influenced based on the fact of being here first best (there was another so-called airport sim released shortly before) vs releasing a playabe EA? Or did you got carried away with the community green-lighting you in 6 days, feeling at the top of the world, and then loosing track of how your game performs in actual gameplay? Because the issues people are posting over and over again (200+ in official bug thread) are generally not OS/Hardware related and you should have seen them in your play throughs - If I have stuck people, you will have them too. If your game makes it impossible to load 777 in 2 in-game hours, so will you and etc ad infinitum.

Or is it simple as 'Oh gosh, we did not really tested or played our game for a few hours' as opposed to catchy update news titles such as 'Bumpy landing' as a result of 'monetarily invested' customers doing the testing for you?

Gosh, I'll be shocked and awed if the developer posts an honest and detailed response, other than the, now stock 'we are working to improve the game, thank you for your feedback' type of response, however it is phrased.
Myself, and parts of community would really appreciate a 'road to...' sort of post.

And unless I'm very wrong and mistaken, my understanding of EA is different to yours, you ought to post something human and acknowledging the poor state of the launch. Ducking behind the 'The game is not yet finished and there are gameplay aspects that are missing or incomplete, and you may encounter bugs' blanked disclaimer is a poor excuse.

While I'm heavily invested in the Airport Tycoon or Airport Inc reboot, this unfortunately has to go on the back burner till at the very least the obvious bugs are fixed. And let me echo what I said before - if we can see these 'right in front of your face' issues, mentioned in paragraph 4, you should have seen them too.

In other words, if you show the lack of care and attention, why would you expect the community to do so?

""Early Acces game are Alpha-Games. If they are beta, they dont need early acces, beacuse its neraly finished....."" -Commenter

Yes, I firmly grasp the idea of a game in the alpha stage.  However, if it's being sold as an early access game on Steam it should, at the very least, be playable even if it's only basic feature gameplay.  

There are many core mechanic issues that prohibit such.  Pathing is one of those core mechanics that should work for the majority of the game before selling as a non-crowd funded game.  For instance, many sims get stuck, and when they get stuck they get angry and do not complete their tasks.  Sims that do not complete their tasks, do not contribute to your bottom line, thus causing issues with your cash flow.  Sometimes it is as bad as 50-60% of your passengers that get stuck.  This is just one example of a core mechanic that has a detremental effect on playing the game, even at a very basic level.  

The reason why I do not recommend the game is that, in it's current state, it does not mean my threshold for what I believe an early access game should be at.",1489028132,1489279956

I am happy to have bought this game, even in its current stage because the devs are really working to make one heck of a game here. I Pray and hope these devs will be like the ones from Prison Arch! And keep pumping out updates on a fast and regurlar basis, not just for fixes and patches but new content and making the game better and better.

This game is very very close to Prison Arch! I have logged somewhere over 300+ hours with PA since buying it on Steam, even more hours before the steam version was released. This game is one major gold mine as long as they release more and more and more content and really make this game into what it has the ability to be!

Even at its current state you can play for hours and have a blast :-)

As more content is released it will only get better.

There are some issues with lag and fps, but it has been reported and the devs are already on top of it and not stopping until they have fixed the issues reported.

I would say purchase this game if you can, to support the devs.

This game, right now, is not playable. It has too many bugs and issues that should have been caught in QA before any form of public release. Any attempt at playing it quickly turns into a bug reporting session and saving the game is rather pointless, because chances are the savegame will either be rendered unusuable by a bug or made obsolete by one of the frequent and desperately needed patches the developers are churning out.

The good news is: The developers seem to realize all of this, too, and they're listening and releasing patches/updates pretty much every day. If they can keep this up, chances are that the game will eventually be in better shape and worth its asking price. Once that happens, I will gladly change this review and recommend it.

(19-Mar-17) As of today, I am enjoying this game much more. They have fixed many of the bugs I've seen already and the game is much more playable. The small details (like the correct runway numbers) are very pleasing - smaller details are always good! Still not worth the price tag quite yet - but it's getting better (also please add clarification on how to use the luggage conveyors - they are very confusing for me).

[b]Original Review:[/b]
This early access game has a lot of potential - it is a neat idea and already has some good execution. The general gameplay management is good at the start at the game and when random events are added I expect the gameplay to improve. The accuracy of full airport management is good for a video game (especially in early development) and I would expect this game to drastically improve over the future of development.

However, every early access game has a few flaws - here are some ones that need urgently addressing by the developers:
- FPS (i experience strange lag points every 2 - 3 seconds).
- the UI isn't great and could do with some fixing.
- right clicking when selected a building tool should de-select the tool - that would be great
- if it is possible, connecting the taxiway centrelines into the gate centrelines would make things more accurate

You could also add possible general traffic and open empty gates up for it - apron parking instead of gates, possibly.

Other then that, the game shows real potential and I'm hopeful that my issues may be address - the development team appear very active (thank you guys!) and so I do think they will.

Overall, reccomended. It may not be worth it's price tag yet - but I'm confident it will be as it goes into Beta or Release.",1488911491,1489944453

As soon as I saw this on steam I added it to my wish list, it looks like Prison Architect but with a cool airport setting. Which really interested me.

There are bugs, pathfinding issues and lack of polish but all things that I would expect at an EA stage. However, after playing for just over half an hour, I felt as if that was enough game time and I had kind of seen everything.  There isn't much in the game at all and I didn't feel like I wanted to come back and keep playing like say when I picked up Prison Architect in Alpha 11 or 12

For me when a dev is asking £18.99 for this EA title I want to be impressed and I just something didn't quite connect with me. The price point needs bought down a bit this early in development it’s just a bit too much to ask. In summing up the base game seems solid and with more updates, ironing out all the bugs, working on the AI and maybe adding a small tutorial and finally a menu screen then I may look at reinvesting. However, at this point in time there isn't that much content so it’s going to be one of those risks to take.  Which as I’ve been stung by EA many times I won't be taking just yet. I hope the devs keep applying updates and improving the games would be cool to see a workshop with real world airports in too.

I just cant recommend it in current state at that price point.

I made a short video on it covering my first bit of gameplay.

Simairport fits to its title but theres still a few issues. So to get started it still has a bit of game balancing to fix. The ammount of bugs is a bit much but they are shooting them down quickly. I have not had too many issues with bugs in my experience but, thats just me. The game has about 2-3 Hours worth of content if you work hard to really do everything and do it somewhat well. It is not that begginer friendly unless you pick up things fast. It is lacking a few features that are definatly needs for the game but you can get arround that with 10-30min of failures. Overall by this update you will be able to get 4-6 Hours of total content and 25-40 min will be more on the boring side. Also they arn't adding more content there just fixing bugs so we are seeing 1-2 weeks untill more content by my best guess. So heres my compiled report of all of that information.

Pros
- 1+ Patches A Day
- New Experience
- Dilligent working devs
- Great Community
- Devs are active in the community
- A amazing potential

Cons
- Bugged
- Lack of content
- 6-8 hours of gameplay
- High boringness to fun ratio about a 1/12

I would rate it a 3.4 Boltz I would recomend to get it now and realize that the game will grow.

Sim airport is an amazing game and totaly is worth it. Now I hoped that it would have costed 10-15 but I still bought it. So here are my pros and cons.

Pros:
-Its subgenre is covered by no other game
-Lots of possiblities
-Devs are active in the community
-Strong Community

Cons:
-Lots of bugs with saving and loading along with other stuff that i have not experinced
-No tutorial(Its on its second day of Early Access so cut it some slack)",1488907784,1489024928

My initial review was when this was released but I think over time its become a worse game. The baggage system was never good but know its cryptic, having to build foundations shouldnt be a thing but theyve made you do it blind, the new sprites are ugly and the UI is worse.  Such a shame and never thought a EA title can get worse over development.


Original review :

I study Aviation/Airport management and I know this is not a hardcore sim (Cant calculate dwell time or level of service etc), BUT it does give a nice overview of basic airport design with all its components.-And the obvious comparison with Prison Architect which is not a bad thing.

It is playable but there are bugs (As the devs clearly stated which is good) such as, FPS drops and certain functions being temperamental like the queues and baggage linking systems. The UI is nice and simple to use, I like that the aircraft have real names (B777, B1900D, B707 Etc) and construction is fairly easy to understand.

It has great potential and will surely be a great game and it seems to be updated steadily already.
(I would say that the price is a little for this ealry stage EA game)

*I would like to see various runway lengths though and the use of rapid exits on runways, also more accurate gate markings (They are on there but the aircraft just pull up regardless of where their nose wheel should be)",1488907028,1552326927

I waited on release day as the game was pushed back further and further. Finally, after getting home from work at 5am I was able to get my hands on the game and see what kind of wonderful funI would be able to have with this game. 

Three hours later I came to the conclusion that it would be months before I would be able to play a game that I could actually immerse myself into and get the $20 value that I paid on Early Access launch day. The game will be good. Of that I'm fairly confident. It's just not very good right now. You can't go more than a few minutes without running into a bug that makes the game nearly unplayable. Your passengers getting stuck in your cafe while their flight leaves without them, or your security line becoming so clogged that almost everyone on the one plane leaving your airport misses their flight. These are just a few of the issues you will come across. And what really sucks is that there doesn't seem to be a fix on the users end. 

If I could do this all over again, I would probably wait and pay the $20 in 2-3 months when the game is actually something that you can play and lose track of time with.

This game is awesome. :) I recommend if you like Sim games and are somewhat experienced with these games as there isn't a real tutorial yet. It's pretty easy to figure out though. I can see myself playing this for a LONG time as it deveops more and even as it stands now. 

Setting up queues are important, as not making them will cause your passengers to congregate, and as there are a LOT of passengers. You want to keep the flow moving by hiring enough workers, setting up queues, buying equipment, etc. (TIP: To set up queus hold down the left mouse button and drag the queue line until your done. Then click the station, and click assign to assign it to that queue.)

You also set up contracts with airlines, adjust the schedule for those flights, expand your airport, hire workers, etc. There is also a small research tree which I expect will expand over time.

The airlines start to gain or lose interest depending on how you are meeting demands of the airlines, and passengers happiness. This is a pretty sweet feature. After starting my 3rd game I met the demand, and passengers moved smoothly and departed. The airlines gained interest, and now I have more contract offers. I also upgraded my runway with lights for night flights. :)


It's really cool to see all the passengers roaming about, and the customization options I can setup. :) This is a definite buy if you like Sim and management type games! :) Also this game seems well made, and runs very nicely for early access; I love it.",1488870209,1488949392

But that is not why I didn't recomend it, the ammount of bugs especiallly in the first few days were so bad the game was completely unplayable.   Since its release I got more time in and I still experience major game bugs. for example:  last night I had my best airport yet and the entire map was basically filled up with my airport,  had over ten flights a day and lag was spred out so it was playable....then I went to save the game and nothing would happen, in the end I ended up losing the entire thing and had to start from a previous save and lost hours of play.   So far every game I have played has ended because of people getting stuck,lag, game crashes, or an airplane or bus got stuck and hault all progression.  

I get the fan boys say well its EA its ok if it has bugs and I agree.  Most of the games I own are EA and 2years after its release they are still bugged...I get it.  But I think if you are to charge money for any game it has to at least be playable, if its so bugged its not playable and money was charged then it shouldn't be recommended.  I'm tired of buying potential only for it to never develop, yet people write a good review and spew about how awesome its gonna be and then more people buy it and hurts gaming because our standards keep getting lower.  

The devs of this game seem to be doing a good job with patches and it looks like the game is in a playable state or very close to by the end of this week.   I have enjoyed most of the last 15 hours of my game play, the first 5 were awful.

-No sandbox mode even though it says there is.

Original Post

I am swinging both ways with this game. I've always love Airport sims and with this being with PA (expect a lot of reference from everyone with this) style game i would pick it up. Not for the fact that its a amazing game right out of the EA gate but more because you are supporting the company and giving them a chance to make this a great game.

 Bug Issues
-Sound bug when fast forwarding
- No Volume Control
- Too Simple and clunky UI
- Crashes Alot (possible memory leak?)

$20 is a little high for this EA title and the content/state of play your getting. If you are strapped for cash or looking for a EA with deep amount of content to play, hold off.

This just goes to show how committed they are. I decided to switch my review to recommend because I want people to give this game a shot  and support the developers.

As much as I would love to recommend this game. In its current state with the current price I would have to say hold off a little while until the bugs are fixed.  Considering this is still not a finished product, new indie studio, I would say it is worth 10 dollars. This game has a lot of potential though...

The developers really seem to care about this game judging by their reddit conversations and constantly pushed back hour by hour the day of release (probably trying to squash last minute bugs or something).  

In its current state, it is hard to play because of the bugs I encountered. The first bug I came accross was sound. After about 20 minutes the sound became gritty and jumbled, i had to turn it down. Also the game became unresponsive, seemed like some kind of memory leak, I had to kill the process..

However; the gameplay was ok. It was not super deep but it was enjoyable (deep enough for early access) and I can see myself sinking a few hours into this.  I was only able to play 20 minutes so I cant comment too much about gameplay.  Basically you make contracts with airlines to come at a certain time. Near that time you get a boat-load of passengers arriving to your airport. Tt was quite a challenge keeping them all happy. A lot of them angry because I was taking such a long time givng out tickets.. lol. 

Graphics wise, it is almost similar to prison architect and/or rim world. I love how the simulation/animation of the different characters work. I like the detail they put into patrons getting in line and buying food. Going through security.  I liked the day/night cycles. These little details make gameplay so much better. The only thing I noticed that bugged me was that the workers do not really seem to move around. They just seem like static sprites. Like the security team just stays at one spot. The ticket guys stay in one spot etc. The janitors do however move around.  I also thought the UI was a bit simplistic and clunky, but maybe thats just me because I like detailed UI's with tons of info from all sides (think paradox interactive games)

[h1]About the game.[/h1]

You will be playing as some kind of person with ""epilepsy"". However the gameplay is like a much cheaper version of ""outlast"". You will have a weapon to defend yourself against zombies and you will have to use your camera to be able to see in the dark. You can't use your camera if it has ran out of batteries so you will have to find new batteries from time to time to make your camera work. Unfortunately i dislike the idea to have these random noises or sound effects from time to time, They are getting stale easily and on top of that almost any ""Horror"" game is using it.  While the atmosphere is there and i am really enjoying it.. One thing what i do dislike about horror games are the ""Jumpscare"" lameness. This game does contain them from time to time as well.

Combat isn't really exciting either. You will mainly hit them and walk backwards. You will keep repeating this until they are dead. Sometimes you are able to hit them through shelves and leave them vulnerable. The combat system does get old quickly.


[b]Ingame Information.[/b]

[list]
    [*] There are options ingame.
    [*] No Logic.
    [*] Has jumpscare moments but gets old quickly.
    [*] Characters has the ability to wield weapons.. Makes the game less scary.
    [*] Atmosphere is alright.
    [*] Has random noises or sound effects from time to time.
    [*] Battery drains like there is no tomorrow.
    [*] Animations are somewhat interesting at times.
    [*] Your character has stamina and a health bar.

[b]Miscellaneous Information.[/b]

[list]
    [*] Certain parts behind you will block you off to prevent you going back to previous area's. This will happen quite often.
[/list]


[h1]Other things.[/h1]

The game is alright-ish.. Not fantastic but not bad either.. The combat system and the ""lameness jumpscares"" thingies are the 2 downsides i have for this game. They are getting old really quickly and could make the game unappealing or uninteresting. The other hand the scenery/background is not too bad and i do like it in some way. Some rooms or area's are interesting or has good atmosphere no matter if this is located outside or inside. So this game is a SO-SO Situation.

It's a short first-person horror game with some combat. While you do have the option to go stealth in parts, the mechanics for it are very simple (just keep some distance and don't move too fast) and most of the time you'll be slicing at zombies. For me this is a positive as far too many horror games force you to be defenceless which gets irritating after a while. Here you are vulnerable but can still fight back.

There is certainly a bit of an Outlast feel here in its grainy camcorder feature, and just the overall atmosphere and setting. Though in this case it's a hospital, and your foes are zombie-like beings rather than mentally-insane asylum inmates. The atmosphere is extremely well done and though not particularly scary, was enough to keep me on the edge of my seat in some parts. Though I liked the ability to fight back, the gameplay feels unpolished with odd melee mechanics and even more odd shooting mechanics (the moment you first switch to third-person when picking up a pistol was more unexpected than any ""jump-scare"" this game had to offer). Due to some bugs and occasional lack of button/clicking response, the gameplay isn't all that good.

As for the story; despite a couple of twists and heavy moments, it isn't particularly complex and not something that would win awards. Wouldn't have minded something longer and more detailed, but given the game's overall quality that's probably for the best. Though it certainly has some themes that would be worth exploring in a larger, more in-depth title, the storyline's nothing to write home about; the first twist was good, but the one just before the credits you can see coming from a mile away.

Roots of Insanity is not expensive, but I'd still say it's only worth a look on special. It's in no way ""bad"", just a bit lackluster. One of those games with a few good features, worth a discounted single-sitting playthrough, then uninstall and not think about it ever again.",1533031519,1534290347

The answer is the latter: it's mostly first-person, with some brief third-person moments when you get your grubby hands on a firearm. Emphasis on BRIEF.

   For the most part, though, it's more like ""Outlast with zombies""; complete with the video-camera-as-your-only-lighting trope, and deja vu-inducing graphics that leave you suspecting that a Red Barrels team member - outraged at being fired in the early stages of Outlast's development - decided to exact his ""revenge"" against the company by recycling an early build into an entirely different game. It really does look and ""feel"" that familiar at times.

   Which isn't to say, of course, that this game is in the same CLASS as Outlast. But it's a fairly impressive effort, just the same; especially for something so clearly low-budget and, well, kinda short.

   That's the first thing many of you probably need to know: this ain't a long'un. A couple of hours, tops, if you REALLY take your time. Which the game doesn't exactly encourage you to do, given how quickly those pesky camera batteries run out...and you really are gonna need that warmth-giving green-screen glow if you're gonna make it out alive. 

   The next question many horror fans are wont to ask these days: is there combat, or is it entirely ""stealth"" and/or chase scenes? The answer to that question is: lots of combat, and a tiny bit of running. No hiding. In fact, the first time you encounter a zombie, the game warns you that you're ""a doctor, not a fighter"" (!)...then promptly ensures that you can't easily avoid any of the combats anyway, by denying you a crouch button and sticking many of the enemies in your direct and frequently narrow path (e.g. corridors).

   That's another question I can happily answer for you: yup, it's pretty linear. Not to the point of tedium - there's still a mild air of exploration - but lovers of ""open worlds"" won't exactly be enthralled. The mapping, on the whole, is solid but uninspired. And the missions, suffice it to say, are exclusively of a find-a-key/fetch-an-item/find-gas-for-a-generator variety.

   In short, if you're looking for originality, you've come to the wrong place. You've also come to the wrong place if you're a stubborn Achievement hunter, 'cause they're apparently all broken after the first two (and never liable to be fixed by the devs, judging by the forums). If, on the other hand, you can admire a well-executed game working with limited resources, and can ignore a few minor bugs and other shortcomings here and there, then this may well be worth your seven-bucks-or-less. 

   There's certainly plenty to recommend here: some decent scares, a tense atmosphere, some genuinely head-f*cking hallucinogenic antics, and combat that is suitably short, sharp and brutal for a game of this tone. My only semi-major complaint, really, is the story...which starts well, meanders in the middle, then very nearly ENDS well, but decides to convolute things unnecessarily in the last moments of the final cutscene. Oh well.

   A bona fide good'un, just the same.

   Verdict: 8/10.

The game grasped me before buying because it seemed like an intense and interesting horror with a great plot. Considering I bought it at special of 85%, refunding it felt like a waste and not really doing damage to my budget.

The game starts off with the sense of terror pretty early on. For the first while until I encountered my first zombie, I really felt the horror of the game. After a jump scare or two and facing my second zombie, I just got over it completely. In essense, the feel of horror lasted about 10min.

I figured out the plot long before the game even got midway as the game gives you a hint here and there, but it actually becomes pretty obvious after a while what is happening and why, so the epilogue was no surprise.

Gameplay wasn't that intriguing. I'm a fan of hack and slash, however when a first-person only consists of three weapons (one you cannot access freely), three kinds of enemies with just hacking and slashing the entire game though, it quickly becomes boring and repetitive. Rarely I would say this, but thankfully the game was short. It took me less than two hours to complete.

Optimisation, is the only thing I'm really going to bash. It was horrible to say the least. Before starting the game It felt like it was way too much for my system. Later on, I discovered that even while tampering and putting it on the lowest of settings was it still too much in certain areas.

The graphics and animations are decent, but a bit stiff, the enemies A.I. is atrocious, hitboxes are weird but... I love that you can see your own body! The level design is not bad, but not very good either. The Sound is not effectively directional, meaning you cannot sense effectively where the sound is coming from like in most other games.

The game itself lacks of polish, and that is noticable, because those little details that makes a game feel awesome to play aren't exactly there. You will find yourself time and time again roaming through rooms full of darkness, lockers and fridges. Same lockers and fridges copy-pasted, mind you. The game can get pretty repetitive and generic at times. These elements can bore the player, although I wasn't particularely bored while playing it. Also There are only 3 types of enemies, as far as I remeber, and the fights are pretty poorly executed. 

It still has some cool ideas here and there and also a cool, but very predictable twist at the end, ...I was seeing it coming a mile away, because the giveaways were just too strong.

I'm honestly surprised this game has a *very positive* rating, but given the price I can understand. Despite the game being far from perfect, I can still recommend to horror game fans, but I definitely won't replay it. If it was possible I'd rate it somewhere between good and bad, in the middle... I would give it a mixed rating, because that is how my feeling are towards the game, very mixed. I expected more.

This was a decent game with some solid spoops. But the achievements don't work beyond the first two so if you're a completionist, you may have a bad time. There were promises of fixing some of the problems along with other bugs but the Devs seem to have vanished. 

When I first started playing this game, it was pretty frustrating. But once I learned to keep my eyes peeled for objects, it was a lot more fun to play. Roots of Insanity reminded me a little of the first Outlast, except without the hiding and you get to fight back. The combat system is meh, but workable. 

[spoiler]You get a knife, an axe, and a gun. Eventually you get to a point where you lose your knife and axe but are still unable to use the gun even though there is ammo lying around. I assume it was dropped with the other weapons. As the game progresses, you find another knife and axe but no gun, you are unable to use your gun until the very end of the game. But it never explains where you find a new one, or why you were unable to use it for so long.[spoiler]

I would have liked more notes but that's only because I'm a glutton for story. I found a few tape recorders as well, but they didn't play anything or have any sound which feels like a huge missed opportunity considering that you are able to interact with them.

I like that there were little powerups everywhere to increase health, stamina, and battery power. I also enjoyed the jump scares, atmosphere, and voice acting. 

All in all it's an ok game that is good for a playthrough. It is in dire need of a bit more polish so hopefully the Devs return and make it so their product works properly.

TL;DR: Buy if you want to play a scary, easy horror game. 7/10.

At first i wasnt sure if this was a ""run away from the enemies""  or a ""kill the enemies""  horror game, but its a ""kill all"" type of game. Even though you run away from some. 
I would say give it a try.

Pros:
No hard puzzles,  (if you even count them as puzzle? the lock at the end might be one, but took 1-2min to solve)
Easy to run through, game guides you where to go.
Lots of jumpscares.
Good voice acting.
Good ending (PLAY THE GAME TO FIND OUT)
Found no bugs running through the game.
CHEAP GAME
Miniversion of Outlast.

Cons:
Felt like I did the same thing through the entire game, all parts of the game is much alike. (find a key, kill enemys, next room, some story, repeat)
The fact that you can kill everything, makes it less scary.
Only 2 different kind of enemys? Would be cool with more.

Despite its flaws it's a fine survival horror game if you don't have anything else to play. It would have been a nice/good game if the fighting animations weren't flawed and most of the achievements broken. Hopefully the developers are working on them.

[h1]- Review below ----------------------------------------------------------------------[/h1]

[u][b]Story[/b][/u] 
The story itself is still really nice.
""As Dr. Riley McClein, you have to figure out what is real and what is not as you try to uncover the mysterious happenings at the hospital, while also trying to deal with your epileptic attacks that have haunted you all your life. You will need to whatever you can to survive the night and most importantly, keep your sanity.""

[u][b]Graphics[/b][/u] 
The graphics and effects of the game are really nice. Only the first cute scene is just fine using an artistic filter on pictures. The game has a fair amount of bright and dark areas. Characters models are quite nice, only the fighting and enemies animations are laughable and flawed.

[u][b]Sounds, Music[/b][/u] 
Nice ambiant music with a nice voice acting, only the scared voice is laughable. The sounds combined to the goose bumps make them a little more effective.

[u][b]Gameplay[/b][/u] 
The game is combining several genres : Action & Shooter, Survival and Horror. 
The game features several difficulties if you checked the options  and that includes a hardcore difficulty.

The game also features stealth as you can bypass or skip enemies before they spot you or by simple walk past them. Hopefully not all of them react like that. 

A puzzle was also added in the second update,easy to solve after you find out how to solve it.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=971545492

At the beginning the game is mostly an horror game : you have visions of the past and some scary visions / goose bumps. Shortly the game will be an action, survival, horror game. You begin with a knife and a camera and you will find later another powerful weapon as well as a gun. 
You can interact with some objects and inspects some items and many interaction are kinda useless : like checking the inside of any fridge or inpsecting scissors or other stuffs. Hopefully you can also find several items to help you : batteries, medicines which are always highlighted. Also the cursor change when you can interact with something.

The camera will let you see in the dark with its nightmode view.
As said ealier do not expect a good action game : the fighting and enemies animations are laughable and flawed. There are also some QTEs (Quick Time Events) involving spamming a button or pressing a button at the right moment. This last one is kinda very tricky as the cursor move really fast so you mostly can't stop it at the right spot. Hopefully this won't make your life harder so I will pass on that.

[u][b]Achievements[/b][/u] 
As said all of the achievements except one are broken. Hopefully the developers are aware of it and are working on it.

Since then, a few updates to the game have been issued, and the developer is active in the forums, supporting the community and actively listening to the feedback of those who have supported them. With that said, some of the pictures on the store page are mildly misleading, as this game does not take place in third-person (except during a section of combat, better explained below) but rather first-person. 

You take on the role of one Dr. Riley McClein, a doctor who suffers from epilepsy. As you attempt to control an oncoming epileptic attack, you decide to make your way back to your office to grab your medicine, only to hear a blood curdling scream coming from the B block of the hospital. Fighting through your hallucinations, you soon discover that many of the staff have been violently murdered, and it's up to you to find out just what's going on in this hospital of chaos. There are notes scattered about, and they're all doctor perspective patient logs that do not fully add to the overall story. The brief cutscenes contribute to some degree, but overall the developer does need to work on their storytelling abilities as much of the plot comes off as confusing; this is mostly due to the fact that the plot bounces from subject to subject. At one point, you're trying to figure out where a scream came from, and then you're looking for the main character's father; at times, it really makes no sense.

Although the plot isn't the strong point of Roots of Insanity, where it does shine is within its creepy, tense atmosphere. The soundtrack and effects that Crania Games chose for this title are superb, and they help to keep a constant feeling of tension within the player even when no danger is readily present. From distant screams, to groaning zombies, and random pounding on the wall, you're sure to be kept on the edge of your seat for the entire hour and a half duration of the game. Not to mention, the dimly, and sometimes not even at all, lit corridors, blood-soaked walls and floors, strewn-about bodies, feasting zombies, and foggy hospital exterior all contribute as well. There are some jumpscares, which have a 50/50 chance to be effective, but the true horror lies within the game's incredible ambiance.

Of course, those who have said that Roots of Insanity reminds them of Outlast are completely right. This title does have a camcorder mechanic, complete with the survival element of needing to find batteries to use it. It's not completely essential, but much of the game is dark, and the camera does help to light your way. You must also find medicine to use when you get injured from fighting zombies, who can take good chunks of your bar away with just a few hits. Traversing from area to area, you will be required to perform certain tasks before a new part of the game will open up, although you will find yourself completing circles and coming back to the same base areas a few times over.

It should be noted that right now, only two of the 13 achievements work. There was an update to the game as recently as May 16, 2017, but it did not address this particular issue. The update also improved the combat system, although it still is a bit janky and hard to get used to. During a fight sequence, your best option is to repeatedly move backwards while swinging your knife or axe at a zombie, and if you're outside you're able to use your gun. However, when using the gun, you enter a third-person mode, which is very weird since the rest of the game is in first-person. The gun provides very little feedback, so the zombie kills feel very unsatisfying to say the least.

Despite all of the downsides to Roots of Insanity, it's clear that Crania Games have poured a lot of love, time, and effort into their debut release. Their inspiration has been wholeheartedly taken from the Outlast series, but they've been able to put a unique spin on a pre-existing concept by meshing it with a deep psychological horror mindset. All this title needs is a bit more TLC via patches and updates to truly polish the product, and then it can stand on its own as an excellent low-budget indie horror title. It should also be noted that the game features excellent optimization, and doesn't suffer from any game breaking bugs or crashes.

The hospital setting, combined with the ""night vision camera"" aspect is definately reminiscent of Outlast... but the line between homage and plagiarism is slightly blurred. 

I was pleased by the voice acting, and the cutscenes seemed to flow nicely; but when it came to the gameplay, the repititive nature of hack-and-slash knife combat gets old very quickly. After awhile encounters with enemies just felt like flat out work. Not to forget the knife. Why give us a pistol if it takes more bullets to kill an enemy than strikes with a knife? 

I will however toss the devs a cookie for the music and sound effects. Those were more frightening than 8 of 10 of the jumpscares/encounters.

If this game ever drops to $4.99 I might reccomend it. But the price of a 1 hour game is up to you to decide.

Playing with the epileptic aspect of your character also makes for some interesting scenes.  But I think the shining point of Roots of Insanity is the story.  While lacking originality in some aspects, such as the generic abandoned hospital, I do like the mystery of it and it leaves you wondering what's going on.  

As far as negatives go - there's a few.  The game is incredibly dark and it makes it difficult to find your way around.  You have the option of using a camera but the battery drain is incredibly fast so it needs to be used sparingly.  The combat is somewhat poor.  You can stab or kick enemies and hopefully they die before you do.  The hit boxes are kind of wonky and it makes it a bit tricky to land a hit sometimes.  As for you getting hit - it's easy to die without realizing just how much damage you have taken.  This is incredibly frustrating in areas where you get numerous enemies lumped into the same room with you.  

As a whole, Roots of Isanity isn't a bad game.  It has it's issues for sure, but things like the story keep it as a recommendation for me.  If you're a bit thrifty with your money, this may not be the title for you.  The price *is* a bit high for what you get and I'd suggest waiting for a discount.  But if you got some extra dough laying around, I'd give it a go.

I'm personally enjoying this game, but be warned there are some caveats. 

So graphically the game is built on the unreal 4 engine so the environments and lighting are damn fine. Sadly the same cannot be said of the monsters and animations that are not so good. Sounds are also good and the limited voice acting is average. 

Controls are somewhat cumbersome, because there is no jump or crouch, and the hit boxes of items you need to interact with are sometimes random. Sometimes you need to be right on top of the object - other times you need to stand further away. This is not helped by the interact icon being a small circle that is easy to miss. In fact I needed to post on the forum becuase I seemed to be stuck - it turned out to be this very issue. 

Oh and of course there is the obligatory camera/flashlight that drinks batteries faster than I can sink a pint of guiness. 

Combat - okay you play as a doctor not a trained SAS soldier, and poor combat never hurt silent hill, so I can be more forgiving here. However there is very little in the way of damage indications to your character so you may think you are still quite healthy and suddenly you die to the monster!  And talking of damage indicators I'm still not sure if the horror flashes cause physical damage or not. 

Also the game relies on QTEs in some places, as well as something I'm not keen on, but you may be fine with.

TLDR - the game is affordable, the basic mechanics are okay, the sound and visuals are pretty good - but it really needs some more polish to be a great game. If you can live with rough edges and like horror then by all means give it a go but don't expect a top drawer experience.",1491428822,1491851363

Kicking legless zombies to 2nd death is kind of amusing though, as well as the ""am I crazy, or is this happening"" psychological elements.

I'll put more time into it, hopfully the mystery is enough to keep me intrigued, but as it stands I don't recommend toots of insanity, unless you're up for some butter knifing, boot fucking zombies and scooby doo mystery solving.

(Note, I will keep the previous review here for the sake of fareness to anyone buying the game, and for comparison.)

I now, strongly, recommend this game as of its latest update. The devs were quick to respond to the issues that a lot of people had made them aware of, and now the game is ultimately playable and very well worth it.

Pros:
-The combat now feels pretty great, with the animations fairly smooth, and enemy attacks easily avoidable. 
-The style of combat captures what Silent Hill and Resident Evil once tried to do; it feels like just enough to get you by, but makes you weary of enemies as to not want to fight in every encounter.
-Now that the game is playable, I really like the enemy design. Its textured pretty well and they can make some horrifying noises.
-SWEET MERCIFUL CHRIST I CAN PLAY THE GAME ON HIGH SETTINGS, FINALLY. The frame rate no longer looks like this game was built on a toaster, and it has really helped with playing it and enjoying it.
-All of my previous pros still stand.

Con: 
-I feel like the addition of one extra battery at the start would make it so much better. The game tends to be quite dark, and despite my constant exploration, I only happened upon two batteries by the time I had reached the basement. The addition of one extra battery would still mean that caution is taken when using the camera for light, but it would make it slightly less opressing when trying to explore dark areas.

Most cons from my previous review no longer apply, however, the jump scares can still be missed and it might leave you wondering what is going on/where to look or go.

Previous Review: 
When I get more time, I will come back and change this, but for now the game isn't quite what it said it would be. 

This review is for the opening sequence, it probably gets better, but for now this is what I've found/think:

Pros:
- Atmosphere and music are amazing! I really like the RE1 style music.
- Voice acting for the MC is actually pretty good, not what I would have expected from an indie game. Good job guys!
-The graphics are actually okay. Even on low settings they don't detract from the experience.

Cons:
-The frame rate is incredibly choppy, even on low settings. The game starts on ultra settings for some reason which can lag out the menu if your computer isn't great. But it doesn't matter much because there's almost no change to the framerate between settings, at least not for me.
-Sometimes the screen will go black instead of into a loading screen; the game hasn't crashed, it's probably just a minor bug.
-Screen goes black during combat, probably because the frame rate actually dies.
-The base mixing isn't great; I couldn't hear the voices over the music, and when I turned my volume up my speakers were nearly broken by the loudness of random noises and jump scares.
-Items will highlight but you have to be rubbing against them in order to pick them up.
-The direction of the scenes means that you can easily miss something your character reacts to, and it can appear that you are taking damage from out of nowhere.
-Combat isn't really great. Now I'm a huge SH and RE fan so I'm used to bad combat, but sometimes the animations don't play out and the screen just shakes rapidly. When I'm using the M2 attack it's hard to see where I'm actualy aiming it.

There are a lot more cons than pros, but I'm sure that it's stuff that can be patched or whatever. For a game that's just come out of Greenlight it's doing much better than some others, and I'm hooked on it from just the opening segment. Unfortunately I don't have much hope that the frame rate or mixing will improve the further I go, so I wouldn't recommend it as of now.",1491382466,1491852159

Slice, Dice & Rice is a interesting game and some may wonder why is there ""Rice"" is in the title? Well, the story mode is centered on a golden bowl of rice, rice! what interesting is that the story of the game is actually continuous tale, divided into eight chapters, one for each character but once the story over there not much left.

2 ""no fun"" things actually.

1> Parry doesn't really work. Sometimes it doesn't trigger at all... sometimes the game gives you this ""rigged"" feeling like it's delaying the AI attack so that your parry is no longer up, and thus you fail to parry... and, this bleeds over into point number 2.

2> I got to the end boss and the game became completely unbeatable. My successful parrying, when it actually triggered, had ZERO impact on the enemy. The Grim Reaper dude was able to instantly trigger a counter strike, contrary to the mechanics mentioned on the Hints page. In fact, all the mechanics stopped working properly at this stage. Multiple full body attacks, whether light or heavy, failed to take him down, yet he was able to take me down with instant counter attacks from parrys, or from successful ""tip"" slashes that should have delayed his ability to respond. For a few rounds I thought, he's the end boss, he takes 2 fatal strikes to take down, okay... but then it reached a point where I was landing 3 intimate strikes and he still managed to come back at me with this instant triple combo of counter attacks. Makes you go WTF man!?!

I was actually enjoying the game in a casual sort of way. Not amazing, but kinda cool, kinda funky... then the HAX came out with that end boss. I tried and tried and tried, and it just became so obvious the game was rigged in favour of the boss it made me rage quit and uninstall, then HIDE from library... never to be played again.

I really like the art style - muted backgrounds with high contrast characters and splashes of color look good IMO. Sound and music are decent but not breathtaking. Characters are pretty varied but pretty cliche - for the most part it's what you can expect from asian-myth inspired game. Story is in similar vein - nothing too impressive but it provides enough reasoning for the action, has consistent mood and is over before it gets boring.

[b]Mechanics:[/b]
Battle system is simple but not overly so. 4 buttons correspond to horizontal, vertical and unblockable attacks as well as parry. There are dash, airdash and ability to cancel your attacks. I did not play it enoght with people to say if that's enough depth to be interesting beyond couple of hours but it does not play too bad.

[b]Technical issues:[/b]
Frame drops were happening from time to time but it was not the main issue for me. Seems like a game has trouble with wireless gamepads - both with Logitech F710 and PS4 pad the game just stopped responding to button presses anfter a bit of play. It happened couple of times on Continue? screen and once on character select. I was able to complete the story only once I connected my old Logitech F310 (or may be I just got lucky for an hour).

	Slice Dice & Rice certainly has a charm of its own. I never really played a game like this before so I may be biased to an extent. The game is short, like very short. It has a story mode for each character, which plays like an arcade mode. Each fight is a best out 3 with a rock, paper, scissors type gameplay. You have 3 ways to attack in several different angles. One strike is enough to put down your enemy is timed right and each character has their own way of fighting. There is no realy defining story here, so if you are looking for an immersive story line of some kind, you might want to look elsewhere. The game can certainly be fun if played with someone else as you have to be on your toes as soon as you start. The premise of ""couch game"" really shines here. I had a bit of fun with the game, but with nobody else to play it with and it not really have an online mode of any kind makes the replayability of the game much lower than it could be. I found myself uninstalling it about a few hours. At the time of this review, the game seems to feel incomplete, especially for its price of $9.99. I would suggest purchasing this when it is one discount, which can drop to as low as $1.99(The price I bought it for, anyway.)

[h1]Interest[/h1]

I liked the [i]Bushido Blade[/i] games back in the day, although I never really got all that deep into them. I don't play fighting games competitively, but I will still check out a game if it has a story mode. [i]Slice, Dice, and Rice[/i] reminded me of old-school fighters with arcade modes that you needed to clear with each character. I liked the setting and art style paired with a [i]Bushido Blade[/i]-inspired combat system.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list]
[*]Combat is easy to pick up—each character has a vertical slash, horizontal slash, and strong attack. However, you'll need to master advanced techniques like parrying and canceling if you want to complete the story mode/compete with other players.
[*]Captures the visceral action of the [i]Bushido Blade[/i] games (although the damage model isn't nearly as advanced).
[*]Good variety between characters. Some are slow but have a long reach, others are fast but need to close their distances. One in particular needs to attack twice as many times to down an opponent, but can also perform counterattacks and simple combos.
[*]Impressive cel-shaded art style captures the era like a comic book.
[/list]

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list]
[*]Uneven difficulty (I played on Normal). Some fights were a cakewalk, others brought a fun challenge, and still others seemed incredibly unfair. One character in particular has a strong attack that can instantly dispatch almost every challenger.
[*]Doesn't always run smoothly; this can make pulling off moves like parries very difficult.
[*]Very bad writing with frequent punctuation errors and some nonsensical lines.
[*]Crashes on occaision and loses your progress in the story with the character you were playing as.
[/list]

[h1]Value[/h1]

I paid 1.99 USD (on sale). I hesitate to recommend this if you're just going to go through the story alone. The combat is fun, but the computer-controlled enemies don't always bring a satisfying challenge and the story itself feels like an afterthought. If you plan to have friends over for matches (there's no online multiplayer), you could do a lot worse for that money. Definitely wait for a deep sale.",1540874950,1540874965

Simple in the way,that you dont need to use a lot of keys or do over the top combos,but it still requires skill.
You need to come up with tactics in a fight and wait for the right time to strike.

You fight as kojiro,a dead samurai, you encounter a new opponent each time,kill him,and make your way to hells ruler,to challenge him to a fight aswell.

Slice, Dice & Rice is 1on1 2D Fighting in it's purest form.

On the surface, the one hit kill mechanic may seem arbitrary and make some characters feel unbalanced compared to others, but if you take the time to learn

a) the different functions of your 3 attack options (vertical, horizontal and heavy)
b) the parry button and your movement abilities

and most importantly

c) [i]how these first two options flow, link and cancel into each other[/i]

you and the person you play with will find a great deal of enjoyment in learning what stands at the core of every fighting game - that is to say [b]when and how to use your toolkit and how it interacts with that of the opponent[/b] - leaving out all the tedious hours in training mode learning combos and steeling your muscle memory.

This game has (thanks to its very minimalistic structure) the right tools to provide fighting game newcomers with a fast and rewarding entry into the very fundamentals of the genre, e.g. spacing, anticipating and reacting to your opponent's moves and the therein resulting mindgames.

The tutorial tells you everything you need to know but doesn't go too in-depth about it (like the most fighting games), but here are some tips if you don't want to figure it out all by yourself:
[spoiler]The Heavy Attack (signaled by an orange flash) can be cancelled during it's startup with a parry or a dash but cannot be parried itself and is best evaded by movement or a quick preemptive counterattack[/spoiler]
[spoiler]Vertical Attacks are best used on the ground against airborne opponents or when attacking a grounded opponent out of a jump[/spoiler]
[spoiler]Horizontal Attacks are quick and often the best air-to-air options but also very easy to parry if you are being too predictable with them[/spoiler]

If you have a sibling, a roommate, a significant other, or just friends over at times who like fighting games no matter if they're good at them or not, give this game a shot and try to keep playing for 2 or 3 matches against the same person under the same conditions and watch as you both rapidly learn each others playstyle and find new ways to counterplay each other.

Sure, some improvements could be made but this is an amazing concept and as far as I'm concerned the developers have done a well enough job for me to recommend it.

Pros:

- It has a unique fighting system. You can die or kill with one hit (most the time it will take 2-3).
- The character design is excellent, it has lots of soul. 
- The controls are good and nothing to complain about. It’s very responsive.
- The graphics are appealing enough. I honestly really like the designs.

Cons:

- I wish there were more moves. 
- I also wish there were more fighting stages.
- It could use more of a soundtrack.
- Blocking works only half the time, even when you’ve timed it right.
- I wish the story mode had voice acting (or at least images) rather than simple text.
- I wish the endings were better. There should be more of an incentive to want to beat it with different characters.

It’s a fun game for the price and has plenty of potential.

I hope the developers continue to improve the game.

This is my first negative review on Steam. Hopefully not permanent as the basis of this game is great but is only let down by button response. And seeing it's a game based on dodging, timing and parrying it doesn't leave much hope.

It's a fighting game similar to mortal kombat but you only have one hit to kill. Against friends it's great as you can have a laugh at others misfortune but against the CPU you really notice the input issue. A mistimed dodge, parry or jump can be lethal so for it not to happen when you ask is a deal breaker.
My rig is solid, I play higher demanding games on higher settings without issue. Although, for arguements sake I lowered settings from fantastic to fastest. Still lag.
At the begining it isn't noticeable as CPU isn't as punishing but believe me, the second you start to play as Benkei in story mode the **** hits the fan!
Benkei, for reasons unknown needs to hit enemies 2-3 times to win a round. He's selling point is his parry... You see the issue? 
Mistimed parry, you're dead. Can't Dodge quick enough, you're dead. One hit kill on Mr Benkei.

If you are into fighting games, this is a nice hidden gem!
However, unfortunately the game was abandoned by the Devs. So don't expect any new updates or features.
Still worth buying on sale.



Now, to the proper review:

Two games come to my mind when playing this: Samurai Shodown and Bushido Blade.
However, Slice Dice & Rice has its own unique mechanics and gameplay, so go expecting a beast of its own kind!

The game has 4 buttons, being 3 for different attacks (light, heavy and upwards) and the forth being a button to Parry.

There is no crazy inputs, no combos, everything here is pretty straight forward, so bear in mind that in the end, Slice Dice & Rice is before anything, a mind game!



Game Modes:

Arcade - Simple and well done! I had a lot of fun with it! You must beat the arcade mode with every single char, in a specific order, to watch the entire story. First time that I see something like this being done in a fighting game, thumbs up for the devs!
(The AI is pretty oldscholl, at first, you think it's hard, but soon enough you realize some patterns and defeat the enemy with no sweat!)

Versus - Human or CPU

Dojo - It's pretty much a training mode, for now it's bareboness, hope it get more options in the future.

For now, there's no online unfortunately, but I really hope it get implemented someday! So I can get salty online, ^^",1498788187,1557771758

Okay, this is LITERALLY my most qualified recommendation to date.  That includes Darkest Dungeon, and I reviewed that a while back; I really wanna revise that one.  Didn't quite have this process down, at that point. O' course, depending on who you ask, I still might not.  

One thing you should know about me: Street Fighter II Turbo was literally the very first video game I ever played.  I have been playing them since age 5, and that was how it started, with my older brother (by eight years) taking it upon himself to teach me how to play the SNES, using SF2T.  So, as you can imagine, I harbor a bias in favor of fightgames.  Please keep that in mind.

I'm going to say this up front: if you are not a fightgame ENTHUSIAST; I mean the type of people who play SF IV/V (possibly also Street Fighter Alpha 2, STILL, if you're like me), or KoF XIII or Guilty Gear Xrd, etc, on campaign mode, or regularly do human-v-computer matches for FUN, and you don't have friends to dick around in this game with, DO NOT BUY IT.  For all my gripes, the reason I feel secure in throwing ten bucks at this is I know it hits notes I particularly enjoy, and it's just functional enough to be something I can throw on for a few days here and there (possibly while drinking) and entertain myself.  If my friends and associates are any indication, I'm something of an exception, so I wanted to be up-front. 

Now that we know the terms, we can get into the specifics.

This game has a lot going for it to start off with.  While taste is subjective, I, for one, am a big fan of the jidai geki genre (you know, classic samurai shit; sword fights, dudes dashing past each other and then suddenly one guy spurts blood and falls over, flashes or ink swipes following sword strikes, general romanticism, etc), and this game delivers pretty damn well.  Shit's sake, there's a guy NAMED ""Yojimbo"", who happens to be my unironic favorite character. And yes, he's wearing a robe, hakama, and kasa (the straw hat thing you see all the stereotypical ronin/samurai dudes wear in movies). There's a wide range, from swift, tessen-wielding birdmen to literal grim reapers (named ""Shinigami"", no less), and smart money says you can find something to your liking here.

If you've played Bushido Blade, you know what you're getting into here.  This game is mindgame-heavy, and a single hit will heavily impair your opponent, assuming it doesn't kill him outright.  For what it's worth, I also got a heavy Samurai Shodown feeling from this (which actually bumped it up more in mind than Bushido Blade did, given my history), but that may just be me.  That ""one-ish-hit-kill"" rule, of course, is less true in the campaign.  You will fight boss characters who can take significantly more punishment. This feels especially unfair when playing Benkei's campaign. As he is unarmed, the game requires you to land more hits than it would for other characters (note: his parry has a built-in counter, and he's lightning-quick, to compensate). That, multiplied by boss characters' health makes for an exponential spike in difficulty. 

Controls are simple.  Horizontal (quick) attack, vertical (heavy) attack, and an unblockable. In an interesting subversion, those first two are not consistent, character-to-character; sometimes your vertical attack is actually quicker than your horizontal attack.  The remaining face button is relegated to an all-purpose parry (although you can also parry by using an attack that strikes in tandem with your opponent's; this is called a ""clash"", instead of a ""parry"", but the effect is largely the same).  The bumpers and triggers do nothing, in direct contrast to most games these days.  Four buttons, one directional pad, be it the analog or the directional.

The graphics are wonderful, but could use a little touching-up.  Everything is largely greyscale, but each character has a primary color that is prominent in their costume.  Tengu's tattoos are green, Yojimbo's scarf is blue, Benkei's gi is yellow, but everyone's majority is black and white, as is the background (save for splashes of red), with contrast set to as high as it can be.  It all looks very artistic, and animation is gorgeous, saturated with frames and fluidity.  About the only issue is that Monkey King's color is, evidently, black, so his sprite is literally just black-and-white greyscale, and Tomoe's leotard (which takes up the most-concentrated part of her model) is purple, which makes her appear unusually garish.  I'm aware I'm nitpicking; it's completely fine, I just think that something that's evidently focusing this hard could be refined a little more.

The sound is fine. Largely.  Sound EFFECTS are pretty sweet; I like the slashes, blows swiping and striking, as well as the ""yooohhhhh!"" when you decapitate an opponent.  The music is... largely garbage.  Well, I mean, the two songs that there are are perfectly fine. It's just that there are only two songs.

The campaign is split into eight parts, one for each character. Think Mortal Kombat IX/X or SFV, although it's only a continuing narrative in name.  Basically, you play one character through eight-ish fights, with little text screens and dialogue every third fight or so.  And most of those dialogues are against a shadow, which basically just growls at you.  Everything is text; no voice acting here.  The story does build, but it's not much of one, so make of it what you will.

As I said before, the difficulty curve is EVERYWHERE. Balance here is....  Kinda not.  Some characters are clearly more effective than others, and I have a distinct feeling some were built as counters to others. Naturally, since the campaign makes you play everyone, there will be some fights which take you ten or more tries, while others might be utterly effortless.  This only gets worse when you fight demon version of other characters, who I swear are faster, in classic arcade fashion. The final fight is utter bullshit (homeboy has even fewer cooldown frames than his earlier analogues, and input-reads harder), but is by no means impossible, if you're persistent.  The ending is a text scroll.  Like I said, not much of a story.

Said difficulty is largely built off matchups. This game is pretty matchup-heavy.  Most characters can make fools of others, and a select few are clearly dev-favorites; they have almost no weaknesses, while others are uphill battles from minute one. This is a larger problem for the campaign, where the CPU knows everything; human-v-human battles don't suffer from this as much.  As a matter of fact, for human vs matches, this can make things more fun as you and your friends find fighters that much up with their natural playstyles and don't have to worry about fighting an input-reading CPU or an accelerated computer-only enemy.  There's a lot more room for mindgames and psycheouts among friends than there is among a man and his computer.

Like I said, fightgame freaks like me will enjoy this and find it worth their money.  Folks with friends who are at least casually interested in fightgames will find this to be something they can play and have fun with, possibly over some brews. They, too, will find this worth ten bucks.  This game is competent, though it has its flaws, but I find it recommendable at its full price, so long as you're among those two groups. If not, I still think it's doing some noteworthy things, but wait a while until it falls to five bucks or less.

I personally like this game so far, the game is solid, not hard to control and simple to understand. A 2D fighting game based around one shot, one kill is very nice to see, even though it is a vary old concept now.

The Aesthetic of the game is well done. A mixed Asian setting is a good choice for a game like this, the soundtrack just makes it more great. Characters have interesting designs, and even differnt mechanics to them, like for example, benki can counter-attack instead of just parry, yojimbo has a dash heavy attack and Tomoe has a divekick.

Story mode is nothing special, but it at least gives me a goal to acomplish in this game, however, im currently stuck on yokai yoketsu, who just keeps dodging all of my attacks and just obliderates me when i play benki story mode, that then really turned me off a good bit by this game, and i wish there was an improvement for benki since he seems a bit underpowered for now.

versus mode is fine, local multiplayer makes it nice when playing it with a friend, makes the keyboard get a bit crowded but simply buying a controller will fix it.

so would i recommend this game? well, best you bought it on a sale, $10 seems a bit much for what the game offers. I'm sure there will be updates that will bring this game to have more replayability, like characters, maps, maybe other game modes and as mention before online multiplayer.

for now, i will leave a positive review on this game, and when a new updates comes, i'll be sure to update. I have high hopes for this game and i hope it will end up being successful.

Total score 7/10
improvement is definitly needed

Damn sad that this concept failed in execution because it's exactly what someone like me who can't pull off a fatality needs. One hit kills no combos no bullshit...heh. Cept thats all this game has, not that I haven't gotten too far but the AI even the first fight reacted to my inputs and not my moves. Press B for heavy and before I start the animation they have flown off to the other end of the screen. Then we get to the tag, the phrase that the developer wants said synonymously with the title ""One Hit Kills"". Except when it doesn't and you end of wounding someone, it does nothing by the way sometimes the AI starts squirting blood spastically in a repeat animation in the middle of the fight as if crouch spamming but it seems to have no affect on what they did next. Only certain moves seem to wound though and it makes no sense as to why other times the same move wounds the next it kills with no difference in execution. Worse offender is the story mode which is in essence Mortal Kombats totem climb story. Play character VS the rest of the roster and then a mirror of yourself and then the boss character. None of the crap holds a candle to Skeletor

Old mate Skeletor has a nice little suprise for you everything but your heavy attack (a huge wind up dodge only leave yourself open suicide move) wounds him. Yep, he has health around 2-3 hits worth of it and the one true thing this game carries in the meaning of its tag ""No Combos"" so you hit the bone boy with no chance at adding follow up as all strikes have recovery time unless you cancel out of it and blah blah blah it still won't let you land 2 hits to actually make him care. So he tanks it and guts you in turn without you being able to one line him for his mistake as he has to make several and you only have to make the mistake of trying to hit him. Well I do lie...kinda. He has a combo a wound kill combo that stun locks on the first hit that he starts when he tanks your hit. You can parry the first strike not the second so why not dodge, oh boy. 

Dodging and parrying as well as the little spicy slow motion mode are possibly the worst used abilities in this game. Sure you can parry a hit but according the hint section this is to enable ""frame advantage"" which the enemy pulls back out off and doesn't care that you just blocked them as strikes take time to connect so you don't get to parry capitalize you get to parry chase. Dodging is the stickiest and grossest feeling you will ever have with this game this ain't no Mortal Kombat or Injustice you don't have an animation you all get some wind effect and slide back be it in air or ground so when you think you want to have a high octane charge parry slice cancel into a dodge you really REALLY don't as the dodge as some weird delay stick and can't be connected quickly to enable smooth movement. 

Onto the system that is just in the game and it isn't useful more often then not it gets you killed its slow motion mortal strike dodging. So in theory (you start with and regain it after gaining distance from your opponent) it activates as a strike that would kill you nearly connects in reality when it goes off you are either in no way in danger or already dead when the point is to give you reaction time to counter the attack it really only adds what amounts to frame lag in a  fighting game.

A really butchered concept that amounts to the AI flipping around spastically whilst you try and spam heavies and down aerials to exploit their poor reception to aerial attacks whilst they ESP your moves.",1493787520,1494075962

Firstly I'll repeat what almost everyone else has:

No online multiplayer: Doesn't really concern me, since I like local play, but I understand what they are going for. Although I feel like this would be infuriating online if the connection isn't one-to-one.

Story difficulty: Oh boy! Remember the premise of one hit kill? Well it will only concern you. Later on enemies will have double or triple ""hitpoints"". This added to some recovery ratio differences makes for some infernally frustrating situations. Slower characters without linking normal attacks will be shit out of luck. The thing I liked about the story mode is that you play it in order so the little story it has makes sense. Character designs are cool and well made, but the character stories are cliche and uninspiring. Yoketsus' (Big sword lady) and Benkeis story was the most fun. 

Control mapping/controls in general: I played the game with keyboard and with controller both. I would've probably played with a keyboard if I didn't have to map them every time I start up the game. Previous reviews have said that the controls seem tight and functional, but I have to disagree. This could be due to the Usaminaminami which slows the game down if someone is getting attacked and they got their Usnaminami meter full. More about the USAnaminam later. Due to the games fast pace, it would be great if you'd know when you have been finished with your recovery frames so you can dash away or parry, but no dice. But don't read too much into that. It could just mean I'm at the bottom of casual scum. This along with the slow-time-downsaminami devolves the game into a button masher. 

Now something I didn't see mentioned:

Usanami, cross ups and moves: I grumbled about the slow down that happens when someone gets hit, but along with making the game feel like it stutters, it seems to grant extra frames to recoveries. So if you wanna do a jumping vertical, you must bait out the slow down first. Once again, this could be due to casual scumness, but since I started to bait the slowdown out first, it has been less of a problem. Take it with my grains of salt. Crossing up the opponent and attacking will make your character attack their original direction, so be careful to not land on the other side of the opponent. Gameplay is fun, albeit there are a few moves that would need a bit fine tuning on their hitboxes. For example Monkey Kings ground verticals animation and ""speed line"" shows the weapon go behind him and go all the way around. Still, hitbox is only on the front of the Kang. Heavy attacks are unparryable yes, but are they clashable? Get back to me on this. Due to the slowdown I stopped parrying altogether, since it messes up the timing of it. Hopefully I'm just wrong, but if I'm not, please patch. You got a fun game in here a bit deeper.

Characters: I'll go through 'em one by one. I don't know for sure if there is more than the original 8, but here goes.

Kojiro: Standard Mr. Standard. Nothing special. He's first character in the story mode. This vanilla boy allows you to get a taste of what's to come.

Tengu: Best guy. Flies like a plane and hits like a plane. Not the toppest tier character tho.

Yoketsu: Girl has hyperarmor on when attacking. No indicators to my knowledge when it runs out, so just be careful. Her parry is an elbow to the face. No idea if it does actual damage, since I cornered the cpu and elbowed until I got bored, but I've finished a few fights in story mode with it. Her vertical hits both sides of her, so Monkey King has no excuses.

Benkei: A refreshing character in this roster. Uses punches and kicks. First character I noticed having a second attack when timing two horizontals proper. Then the slowdown always messed the rythm and I started to just smash it with better results. His parry is a counter which you cant continue with another horizontal. 

Kyoko: This character made me feel like the others were unfinished. Three horizontal combo that moves pretty far. Doing a backdash and immediatly doing a horizontal is a sure kill more often than not. Jumping vertical is a divekick which can be continued with a horizontal. Her ground vertical is pretty damn good. Kyoko feels like the actual boss character of the game.

Shinigami: Jumping skell. Good reach, but feels slow on a start up. So just jump and horizontal your way to the top. If the opponent jumps towards you, just do a jumping vertical. It makes a box of kill around Shinigami.

Yojimbo: Fun due to the heavy attack being a cliche sword dash thing. Otherwise pretty mediocre.

All in all I kinda regret buying it, but I haven't played versus yet. Maybe that's where the fun is at.

I'll add things and correct myself if needed.

The parry-cancelling that allows you to bait attacks for example, or combo two attacks. Jumping isn't broken, which makes it very tense throughout each round, one mess-up can mean everything.

A MAJOR buzzkill for this game is that there isn't any online for the multiplayer. I was hyped for this game when I saw the mechanic shift from health bars, and was hoping to be able to play against other people, but that's just not the case and on a keyboard, it's too cramped to play 2 player and though you can use a controller, that requires spending more money on one if you don't already own one.

Another kill for me, was the control mapping. The controls themselves are fine, but it doesn't save your controls for each time you launch the game. Something like that is quite vital for almost any game, as I'm already used to a different button mapping from playing a game similar to this.

No online MP, but I enjoy the AI. It gives me a workout and the stories are decent enough. Nice Mortal Kombat style ham, and some cool boss characters along the way. I will get my moneys worth just from the vs AI, I think.

This masterpiece redefines how we as humans play modern video games and gives a brilliant critique on late stage capitalism, making it a strong contender for game of the year 2004! Whilst playing this game you really FEEL like you are the Dungeon Creepster himself, creeping through dungeons and fighting terrifying monsters. The use of the Frostbite engine really enhances the experience, vastly improving on its predecessor ""Dark Souls 3"". I expect great things from the next game in the Dungeon Creepster franchise, Cyberpunk 2077. I have nothing but the upmost respect for the devs who worked 24/7 on this marvel of a video game.

The game has no story, it only appears to care about high scores, in terms of progression. You can go through green portals to go to the next levels, and there are boss levels, but there seems to be very little progression other than that. It has 500 achievements, these 500 achievements can be gotten within 15 minutes, and I regret playing the game without checking how many achievements there were. Always check how many achievements there are before playing a game.... 

The achievements are unlocked simply by killing monsters. The monsters come at you at an insane rate, and each monster has only a couple (if not 1) of hits until it dies (except for the boss of course). They don't seem to do a Hell'va  a lot of damage either, the most damage you get is from existing. Your health goes down each second, to act as a timer, and you can heal yourself with cooked chicken found in random parts of the dungeon.

There are weird pick ups scattered about that seem to relate to special moves, but you won't need to use them that much really, as holding down left mouse button, for the entire game, is enough to kill basically everything. The game never gets difficult enough to really need the special moves.

I got a 90% OFF coupon for this game. It was pretty cheap already, and it had trading cards, so I figured ""Well, why the heck not?""

Before actually buying it, I took a peek into the existing reviews, mostly negative and 'non-recommended' ones, which makes sense.

I saw a lot of reviews from people that got the game the exact same way I was about to, and most of them agreed it was a nice way to get some trading cards since the game was so cheap. 
I quickly understood the concept of a ''Achievement Spamming game'' even though I had never actually seen one.
I was pretty sure the game was no GOTY stuff based on the reviews, but part of me really wanted to try it out, since so many times I bought games hated by the public and really enjoyed them...
Then I download the game, and launched.

''WTF'' was my reaction. 

That thing's weird. It feel as though I'm playing some kind of prototype test software from a 10 year old blind drunk kid who just got unity game maker or some sh*t. Can barely understand what's going on in the screen, there's a constant male moan (supposedly from your character) who sounds like Obi-Wan 0rgasming while hanging upside down. The enemies are spiders and ogres... And some kind of retared caterpillar. You run around (Or stand still, for all I care) while you shoot colorful magic balls. You're supposed to collect colorful orbs that float around the dungeon to get power ups and throw other kinds of colorfur spells into the few enemies that soon become a trillion and reduce your FPS, which is already most likely low since the game runs like crap.

This game feels like it should be on an alternative dimension AVGN episode, not on steam for 2 dollars.

Is a 15 min. long achievement spam game, where you'll get 500 achievements for pointing in the direction the enemies come from; but since the creeps come from every direction, you can just spam around like a headless chicken - this game actually made me feel like one. 
Tip: Stand in a corner, go and make a cup of tea!

I bought this on a high discount, so the cards were worth more than the game. Also I sold my kidney, so i'm a rich ass beast right now. 

You get 500 lazy achievements, which can look good on your profile.

A nice game to powernap to since it'll have a draining effect on your brain-activity. 

[h1] Negative Dungeon	[/h1]
Short spam game - very repetitive.
No storyline or real progress.

The controls are horrible - Very sluggish.
I never bothered figuring out how to change between spells either.

You can't adjust the in-game settings, and there's no option buttons.

I saw no trace of fluffy unicorns, which is a lack in many games.

You're paying for achievements and cards, that's it.

You'll be done with the achievements in 10-30 minutes, depending on your system setup, and then it's just a case of grinding until you've got your cards.

Dungeon Creepster is a rip off of Gauntlet, a top-down shooter spawning masses of enemies. Just like in Pain Train, the GUI is similar, the main menu is the same..what's this? A new developer? NOPE. It's just the Pain Train developer operating under a new dev name because they know their games suck and they're desperately trying to run away from the bad hype by creating a ""new developer"" to develop the same game, just with a top down perspective...wait a minute you guys are really bad at this whole ""we are totally not the Pain Train guys""!

Dungeon Creepster is by no means a good game. Controls will wonk out on you, there is no objective (you don't even have to kill enemies until you get to bosses if you don't want to), bosses are just the same enemies you fight - just bigger, enemies walk through walls, you have no clue how to use your ""special skills"", sometimes you'll get something out of a treasure chest and other times you get literally nothing, which is dumb because treasure chests are already hard to find as it is.

From the makers of ""Pain Train"" comes now this topdown dungeon shooter. Ofc you shouldn't expect too much. It still has the principle to have certain spawnpoints which you can destroy. After this you can enter a new level over the by green arrow marked green spawn. Which each level the HP of your oppenents gets higher. On the 3rd level there is then this ridiculous boss ""Dungeon Overlord"" with a wide open Spellbook in his hand.

Enemies will spawn out of generators until the generators are destroyed.  Find the portal to get to the next floor and more enemies.  Every few floors face off against a giant boss.

Overall the game tries to work on sensation overload.  And it isn't terrible, although the sluggish controls got annoying.  Still, for the price, I enjoyed my time with it.  Just remember you are getting a poor man's guantlet clone.... for cheap!",1490480094,1490480094

It's a clicker.
Pretending to be a RPG by adding a skill tree.

Even clickers pretend to be RPGs nowadays. There is no bottom to how low the genre can be dragged down.

CONS: The level cap is too low(25/35), as are the skill points for the skill trees. One of the most enjoyable things about RPGs is being able to level up beyond your opponents difficulty level. Lowering the required skill and tailoring the difficulty to your preference, eventually becoming a demi-god. There's SO much variability in the spells and their respective trees, I wish I could have had more slack to play around.

[*] The scripted encounters in the game are genuinely funny (most of the time). This is particularly the case when the game pokes fun at RPGs and MOBAs, either by citing standard tropes or by having the characters spout traditional dialogue.
[*] The customization of the various spells you have access to (about 15 in all) is impressive.
[*] The game play is fresh (for a while).
[*] The game doesn't overstay it's welcome in length.
[*] Graphic style is nice.
[*] Item finds were nice and somewhat interesting.
[/list]

YMMV:
[list]
[*] While the game has over 15 (presumably well-thought and interesting) spells, you can only use four at a time. Further, the game's upgrade system for the spells doesn't provide you with near enough stars (i.e. upgrade points) to be able to fully, or even mostly, upgrade the four you are allowed to equip. As a result, you will likely not use more than six spells the entire game.
[*] To the point above, you are able to respec these stars at some point, but it isn't free. While the cost isn't completely prohibitive, it isn't necessarily cheap either. I would have preferred that the dev either 1) give us enough stars to mostly/fully upgrade 6-7 spells w/o allowing for respec OR 2) keep it as it is (though a few more stars would be nice) making the respec free.
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*] While all of the RPG/MOBA humor really hit its mark with me, I can't say the same for the gender-based humor. It seemed mostly directed at immature teenage boys from eras' past. However, some of the comments and gags crossed a line with me personally, to the extent that I would prohibit preteen kids from playing the entire game. The worst was an explicit drawing. At its best this may get a chuckle from a few, while restricting access to potential gamers who might have enjoyed his game. Poor judgement from the dev here.
[*] While the scripted fights were much appreciated, the frequency of the random encounters was not. Exploring was a major PITA. With no overworld map, it was very cumbersome to get my bearings when a 2-minute fight breaks out every time I take 10 steps on the overworld. Some sort of stealth mode should have been enabled allowing us to skip random encounters, at least on the overworld. Walking anywhere was torture.
[*] I played with the mouse, which was fine for the most-part. However, on numerous occasions I accidentally used a “super” power (which should be saved for tough fights) due to proximity/UI issues. Certainly, a better clicking spot for the activation of the “super” power exists.

[/list]

On the whole, I found HQ to be a fun and funny experience. I did grow weary of the game play after a time, but I was in end-game by then. I think somehow reworking this game, or a sequel, allowing (through more stars or looser respec) and then incentivizing the player to utilize more than just 4-5 spells would give this game much more replayability. I played on normal. If I liked the game more I would try on hard, but I think it would just be much more of the same. Gameplay was short, but if you pick this up on sale (I got mine for $6) you should be OK.

- Grindy

[h1]Pros/Cons:[/h1]
+ Meme story
+ Most battles start with a bit of dialogue
+ Loading before the final boss allows for completion 
+ Majority of loot provides unique bonuses, not just stat creep
+ Solid skill trees.  Turn your abilities into passive smart heals, stronger direct heals, give them alternate functionality, etc.  

+- There's an... art style
+- Lite character creation
+- Respecing could be more flexible
+- Equipped weapons show in combat
+- Only having 4 hotkeys encourages build variety, but makes most spells redundant.   

- Random encounters
- Menu at the start of every combat
- Getting a perfect is rare, and mostly luck
- The default healing spell is very... non-standard  
- Had a couple game breaking bugs related to dialogue, but managed to un-break them
- Having to re-activate meditate after literally every spell is a bit ridiculous.  Maybe it could be a toggle that halves your healing while active or something?  
- Lacking HUD.  There are no numbers, in a game all about numbers.  No de/buff icons with timers.  Damage numbers show on the party member who dealt the damage, instead of the enemy.  Strange.  
- Controls are backwards for a healing simulator.  What should be click2target > use ability, is instead: select ability > click2cast.  Seems like this would be easy to implement as an optional playstyle for the upcoming GOTY edition.",1577049521,1578484464

I doubt you'd really want to visit it again after you're done, as the playthrough on normal difficulty is challenging enough as it is. Maybe a bit pricey for a 10 hour experience (get it on a sale).

Some issues I had with the game:
- So you can invest stars to improve certain spells, and there are hidden synergies which must be unlocked. But you're expected to switch different spells for different fights. *twitch* But the game only allows you to take back the last point, not all the preceding points. *twitch intensifies* God forbid you actually make a *gasp* mistake while sinking points in or calculate the points you needed wrongly.
Oh, there's a respeccing option... that is expensive. Really. Well, maybe I can test different builds using save slots...
...and there's only one save slot so you can't take back all the mistakes you made in sinking in points or test different setups. Geez.
So in the end, what will players end up investing in? The most boring, basic spells that are universally useful.

You are the Healer and go on an adventure with your group of bad players. They only care about damage, they have no focus and they blame you for everything. Typical Mmorpg feeling for every Gamer that ever played a Healer in a game. 

Pros:
+ Lots of Spells that encourage different playstyles
+ every spell has a solid skill tree
+ if you fail a boss fight you can adjust your spells to go for a different approach
+ experimenting with skills encourages multiple playthroughs
+ lots of humour (maybe i'm easy to amuse but i laughed about every dumb joke in this

+ good characters (even though they all suck at fighting!)
+ unique artstyle
+ good music
+ has a good amount of depth to it even though it may not seem like it at first
+ you get trolled a lot

Cons: (if i have to name any)
- moving around the world map is a little bit slow and makes exploring the map a tiny bit 
  tedious
- too many ""endbosses""

All in all i highly recommend this game.

Healer's Quest ist ein spaßiges, kleines Spiel in dem sich jeder Mmorpg-Heiler direkt zu Hause fühlt.

Man übernimmt die Rolle des Heilers in einer Gruppe aus schlechten Abenteurern die ohne jegliche Taktik, ohne jedweden Fokus vorgehen und die keinerlei Respekt gegenüber des Spielers haben. Eben genauso wie es jeder kennt, der jemals in einem Mmo die Rolle des Supports übernommen hat. 

Pros:
+ Viele verschiedene Zauber
+ Jeder Zauber hat einen soliden Skillbaum
+ Zauber sind vor jedem Kampf anpassbar, damit man immer die richtige Taktik nutzen kann
+ Guter Humor (hab so ziemlich über jeden Witz schmunzeln müssen)
+ gute Charaktere (auch wenn sie alle schlecht sind!!)
+ einzigartiger Grafikstil
+ gute Musik
+ hat mehr Tiefe als es zunächst erscheint
+ man wird oft getrollt

Cons: (falls ich welche nennen muss...^^)
- das Bewegen auf der Weltkarte ist ein wenig langsam und macht die Erkundung dieser

Ever noticed how the healer is never the main character in any other game? Critically important, but often overshadowed by the slayers of dragons. And of course, you are the one who has to deal with it when your teammates mess up and bring down a mess. This game takes all that and dials it up to 11. I

It's also surprisingly hard for what is a silly game at heart, with real choices for skills, skill customization, and loadout. It can get pretty frantic, and dying is a thing that happens. Naturally your party will blame you. And get grouchy.

Lets just say that I adore this game and would love to see more. I would warn that it's probably a niche concept, as if you don't enjoy the humor style and your poor healer being always hated on or ignored by the world, it may not hold the same appeal.",1524395152,1524395286

When you reach a monster you can't beat your only real choice is to walk back and forth between previous monster trigger areas, fighting an identical 2 sets of monsters again and again until your party has levelled up enough to be able to take the next set of monsters.  Only you levelling up gives very minor customisation upgrade, while all others levelling up just add a single stat such as +1 minimum damage.  The current price level (£10 on sale) seems too high for what you get.
Having said that, I've had a reasonable amount of fun - and when feeling tired and looking to relax, it can be nice to have a less strategic more casual game like this available in the library.

Gameplay itself is similar to what you actually do as a healer in an 5-man-MMORPG party. You can have 4 active spells, which you can upgrade about a dozen times each, in various ways. There's normal healing, regeneration, shield spells, buffs, resurrection, you name it. But you can just have four of them equipped.

Before each combat you can however reassign your active spells, drink potions, reshuffle the inventory. You can also flee combat or bribe the enemy. 

There's a weapon and a trinket that each character can equip, with varying stats and abilities on it. 

Gameplay is somewhat hectic at first. If you don't like healing in MMORPGs, you probably won't like it here. You have constantly focus on several things: Each guy's health, your mana, current spell mechanics, status effects (stunned/charmed/..) and each guy's ULTIMATE bars.

Health and ULTIMATE status carry over to the next fight. Try to end fights with high health and feel free to carry your ULTIMATE attack over to the next fight, instead of wasting it on a half dead rat.

Despite a clear lack of voice acting, it is nice to actually see some humorous writing and clever characters. From the character selection screen to the twist of the first ""real"" boss fight, the game is self-aware, has many running gags, and shows to the masses the wit that characters should have in an RPG.

The spells are nice, though you're limited to 4, and I've found myself swapping them out constantly depending on the enemies I fight. The game forces you to chose your spells and team's items wisely, otherwise you'll find it very difficult to win and heal through each fight. The punishment for ""wiping"" your group (yes, I played priest and pally heals for years in WoW) is pretty relaxed, but overall the item choices change your game and spells WILL need to be upgraded and changed out regularly to complete your conquests.

I do think the mobs can spawn a bit too frequenty, but I haven't chosen to bribe or run from any conflicts, so that might offer some balance.

It's even more amazing when I found out there's only one guy making this game. Obviously his passion for this game makes up for the lack of staff. The game is witty but not cringey, challenging but not Dark Souls, and grindy(ish) but not Runescape. Encounters are varied by having special modifiers, like a character starting with a debuff or missing a character all togeter. For $15, this game is well worth the money. Replayability is huge since you can only specializee in so many skills without being too spread out. Character customization is simple but good. Equipment makes for interesting builds, and the characters themselves all have their own personalities.

Let me start off by saying I LOVE healing/supporting in multiplayer or RPG games.  It's my favorite thing to do.  I am/was a support/healer main in Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch, League of Legends, World of Warcraft, and Elder Scrolls Online, just to name a few.

The game starts off with you as the healer (see title), 2-3 spells, and some basic character customization.  You quickly play through the ""tutorial"" and gather up your party members, who have a distinct and comedic under-appreciation for healers.

Gameplay is essentially divided into 3 parts:

1) Adventuring through the overworld to find shops, inns, dungeons, and loot chests, along with random enemy encounters.
2) Exploring dungeons found in the overworld which generates another sort of overworld with loot, enemies, and encounters.
3) Combat:  This is probably the most in-depth part.  You have a small party of heroes (?) that automatically fight for the most part, and your role is the healer.  You cast spells and buffs to help out your teammates and ensure their survival and victory in fights.

Spell variety is fairly unique and you unlock them as you level up, with several different ways you can play the healer.  If shields are your thing, you can do it, if you want heals over time, you can do that too, or if you want to play a burst healer that's available as well.  Each spell has multiple upgrades (active and passive) that you can apply to them as well as you grow stronger.

There's also some basic RPG-type equipment; as battles progress you can get weapons for each of the heroes (not you), rings for those heroes, and bracelets for the healer.  All of these have different effects on the characters.  Each NPC hero also has a super ability that can be activated during combat to gain an edge.

The graphics/art are not impressive, but they get the job done.  The music/sound effects are fine.  Interactions between characters are sort of tongue-in-cheek humor; some of them are funny, others a bit lame, but you can tell a good amount of effort was put in to make the game humorous and not cringey.

I haven't found any bugs or errors so far.

I HIGHLY recommend this game if you need to satisfy your craving to heal/support others.  If they had a AAA version of this game from a major developer with fancy graphics and music I'd easily pay $60 for it, but this definitely gets the job done.  It's very enjoyable and I'll definitely be playing more.  I would love a sequel to this game.

The game is about as ridiculous as it says, and I got a good laugh from Character Customisation alone. All the other little jokes along the way are quite good too, and I enjoy the humour a lot.

As far as gameplay goes, it's moderately complex, and faced with lots of abilities early on makes me want to find the optimal set up... except that can wait until I learn not to run out of mana! It's fun, but requires quite a bit of focus. It's clear that failure is a part of the game, and you shouldn't really feel bad about letting a character or two go down.

Normal difficulty is proving a fun time - I've come close to losing, but pulled through a couple of times I thought I wouldn't. A pretty good balance, at least around the start of the game (yet to progress beyond).",1524107770,1524107770

It is your job to keep your allies healed and buffed while they dish out damage to your enemies. Although the basic premise is simple it conceals a very detailed and customizable combat system. You design the look of your character, select from dozens of spells (heals, buffs, or mana recovery), equip different bracelets for your healer and weapons/rings for your allies. Each of your numerous spells has its own extensive talent tree that allows for multiple tactics. Do you prefer to heal allies after they sustain damage using standard heals, buff them to enhance their offensive abilities, or ward them against incoming damage using shields? You can build your healer according to your preferred style of play, mixing and matching up to 4 spells per battle.

What I Like:[list]
[*]Character's appearance, alignment, and inherent power can all be customized
[*]Healing style can be tailored to your individual preferences
[*]Talent trees for each spell and a wide range of equipment for you and your allies gives a fulfilling sense of progression
[*]Humor is quite good (albeit silly at times) without detracting from the core gameplay
[*]Good replayability by changing your lineup of spells and talent specs
[/list]

What I Dislike:[list]
[*]Dialogues before every battle can get tedious, but they can be skipped
[*]Some spell talent trees require investing into other spells to unlock certain nodes, which you may not wish to use (only a few for some spells, however)

Dark Legion was one of the first FPS games I played so I had nothing to compare it to. Its no Half Life Alyx and its no Serious Sam........BUT when it first came out I thought it was a pretty good shooter. When I tried the shooting range training at the beginning the aiming was really good. (and still is IMO) 

The locomotion is the better option because smooth is a little too slow. 

I know there is a shotgun in this game but now (2021) for the life of me I cannot seem to locate it. It wasn't in the training and wasn't in the game during my 2021 play through.......not sure if they removed it or not but that messes up some of the achievements if they remove it from the game. 

The flying bugs........not the best enemy.....when they are retreating they are almost invicible. I'm not missing when i shoot them but they don't take damage until they fully turn around to face me.....

The robot assistant....(not the chick)....he is probably one of worse parts of this game. While he should be helping you find chests or directing you where to go he is really just GETTING IN THE WAY OF MY BULLETS when I'm shooting the bad guys.....He just needs to be removed from the game......

On the positive side going through the levels around that bad, the occasional wave or 2 or 3 come at you and you have to pretty much search for chests or password codes to get around. 

I only recommend this game because it was one of the first FPS's I played but it doesn't seem to have aged well. I also only played it again because I had Vive wands.....this game is very unplayable with Index controllers IMO.

Its also no secret that anyone with over 10 hours of gameplay on this game is probably just hanging out with the chick at the training center......who knows why......

Pros:  
The things they get right are pretty nice.
Reloading is smooth even though it's annoying to ""reach behind"" yourself when you want to grab another mag.
The graphics are nice on some objects and others.. less so.
The movement is pretty speedy and lag-free if you use teleport.
The aiming and bow mechanics are spot-on.

Cons:
The things they don't get right.. are waaay wrong.
When you try to teleport while holding things like a grenade or a breaching charge, you teleport UP and get stuck.  Have to kill the game and reload.
Crashing occurs often.  Pretty much after every level during loading.
Their English is horrible.  Not that it affects the game once you figure out what they are talking about in the tuturial, but that's a challenge all to itself.
The annoying repeating of monologues is insane.  The woman in the tutorial for example  If you don't move to her right away, she repeats the same crap over and over and over and over and over.  Or if you don't teleport near the little droid, he'll keep beeping and waving over and over and over.
Getting things off your belt is really cumbersome.  If you need anything other than a weapon you can scroll through using your right D-pad, you'll have to look down at your belt and try to highlight what you want (such as a grenade, breaching charge, etc) between other things.
Pulling the pin on a grenade?  Good luck.  Vive controllers smash together constantly.
Racking your charging handle on the assault rifle?   Good luck.  Same issue and it's incredibly tempermental too.  You have to grab it JUST RIGHT.  Definitely not something you can do on-the-go if you're the average player
Want to use the sniper?  Good luck.  It's a bolt-action rifle which means you're going to have to cycle your bolt with your off-hand between each shot.  Which means you can't really use both hands to aim which makes the sniper rifle all but useless.

All in all the game has some strengths, but they haven't fixed simple issues like the crashing and the teleporting through the ceiling and getting stuck in walls?  This game is supposedly EA but it's been out for years.  I'm pretty sure they're done with whatever they are going to do with it.

[u]You can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/xD6100YBhGc[/u]

I absolutely enjoyed playing this game. Unfortunately, it has a lot of issues so I can only give a tepid recommendation. This is a light action arcade sci-fi FPS that's B horror movie quality. It's teleportation by default, but you can add in full locomotion and snap turning in the options. It does have this vignette when you turn that you can't turn off. You also have magnet hands to pick up items.

Whole game took me 2.5 hours to complete. It's definitely a casual shooter. There's nothing too difficult about it. You have various different weapons and they are all pretty satisfying to use. There's also quite the variety in enemies, but unfortunately, the enemy AI is not the best. There's also boss fights. I believe there are 3 total boss fights. Again, they aren't that difficult. The bow is sometimes needed to bring down their defenses.

The biggest issue with this game is that it crashes each time you complete a level. It's more annoying than anything else. You have to restart the game and then you'll start where you left off. I also experienced a severe bug where one of the enemies goes invisible and invincible and kills you. Luckily, upon quitting the game and then restarting it, the issue was fixed (however, just restarting the level does not). 

[b]Rate 6/10. I had fun, but this game is definitely not for everyone. Buy on sale only.[/b]",1516085740,1562458492

For free or for a very small amount of money, say £2 or less, this game is not too bad. For anything more than that, I'd be upset that I bought a broken game.

[b]The ugly[/b] first:
[list]
[*]The game crashes on every level transition, including when defeating the last boss. Normally, it autosaves right before the crash so you can just jump back in and carry on. On killing the end boss however, the game crashes instantly (again) and when you reload, it dumps you in an empty boss room with no way to progress, so.... you don't actually get to see the end game movie/credits/whatever.
[*] It bears repeating, on top of crashing in-between every level, I persevered through the crashes and my reward was to know I beat the game but never get to see the ending.
[*] As many others have stated, the dumb little flying robot is idiotic, it frequently gets right in the way of where you want to shoot whilst you are getting shot back.
[/list]

However, this game does have some good points.

[b]The good[/b] a.k.a. the reasons I persevered with this game:
[list]
[*]I actually quite like the main duck/cover and shoot mechanics on how you do most of the fighting. It's a bit contrived, with extremely basic enemy AI particularly, but nonetheless I quite enjoyed ducking in and out, popping off a few shots and reloading.
[*] Weapon selection and reloading is again nicely done for the most part. You can pick up weapons off your belt in either hand and use the other hand to pull clips from the back of your belt, pop the clip in the gun and, depending on the gun, also pull the lever to prime the gun and start shooting.
[*] In particular the pistol, which is the first weapon you get, is great fun to use (although that is also a bad thing).
[*] The bow as well is quite well done. It's been done well in other games too but it works well here also.
[*] Depth perception is spot on, which means you can shoot from the hip, shoot round corners, but also use iron sights very effectively for well placed headshots.

[b]The bad[/b] (or just not so good):
[*] The trigger activity depends on the context of what your hand is pointing at, and the game can get very confused. If you are struggling to pick up a gun from your belt, it's probably because your hand is pointing at something on the floor or wall you can interact with.
[*] Weapon balancing is iffy. I spent most of the time using the pistol because it is a) easy to reload b) has no spread, c) the iron sights are extremely accurate and d) the pistol has infinite ammo. The shotgun is little more than useless, the automatic rifle has too much spread, you only use the bow when you need to because drawing arrows taking time, and the rocket launcher is squandered on anything except bosses.
[*] The sniper rifle is worthing singling out. It has a top-mounted zoom display so you can try those round-the-corner shots. However, the zoom level is quite high and my hands are just not steady enough to use the rifle effectively. There has to be a way to solve a lack of steadiness, it's not like you can lean on anything to steady yourself.
[*] Your female companion, who helps you through the initial tutorials, is ridiculously dressed. The arse-tight leather and pointy nipples will appeal to the young lads I'm sure.

In summary, this is a game that has some promising features, but let down by the typical silly game breaking bugs one finds in far too many Indie VR titles. As a result, I have to give it a negative rating.",1510690849,1510690849

Things I Like:   
      - Graphics Are Beautiful! 
      - Gameplay is Smooth as Butter Everything Works and Works Well...
        (My Rig is a i7-6700 16gb DDR4 GTX 1070)
      - The Controls Are My Favorite to date...For Movement, You have a option between ''Teleport or Smooth'' which, Smooth is what I Recommend, it is Touch Pad locomotion with Wrapping which is the Best I have Used So Far! you can't Run!  but, you don't need too...When you can 'Wrap' around like a 'Ninja'...for example: I had a Rocket coming straight for me almost hitting my face and I simply Wrapped to the side to avoid it...Awesome! The Coolest Pick Up Mechanics No Bending Over everytime to pick something up just move Green hand icon over the item and hit Trigger...Awesome!
     - Very Fun- Advice always look behind you and have a Magazine in hand ready to load because it gets intense pretty quick! you'll need all the bulklets you can get...

It only allows you to move at like retarded, turtle speeds. Like 2mph. With no ability to sprint? This is just terrible design and feels like nobody actually tested it. And if they got some guy to test it, he was completely unaware of successful vr fps's like Pavlov, BAM, Doom 3, Seroius Sam tfe (hell, even Onward lets you move faster, and even lets you sprint). For a game of this price, this is unacceptable. Because this is an easy fix, a no-brainer. Devs can learn from other games, in which there is a speed slider for smooth motion, allowing players to choose what works for them. But as it is now, it's game-breakingly slow. Like a 20$ joke. 
Also, it forces you to complete a tutorial and to achieve some kind of minimim score with each weapon. This is bad game design too (just like in Ahros the One Chronicle). Don't make us take test if we don't want to. Let us play the dam game if we want to. 
Sniping rifle is bugged; almost impossible to cock it, making it impossible to pass out of the tutorial...

This is a good game otherwise flawed by poor enemy, both in their visuals and poor AI (it's not smart at all). Take this out the equation and you have a great looking game with a decent assortment of weapons which have a great feel and function in VR. The level design and overall intuitive feel within this fantasy world is top notch. 

Back to the bad bits. A lot of the aliens aren't very imagitive, stiffly animated but worse is the pathfinding. Aliens are triggered by your close proximity, they are quite dumb, some you can see in the distance remain as statues until you're in range. Then run or fly at you in straight lines, they clip through each other and sometimes the scenary or can get stuck on the scenary. The combat isn't terrible or completely broken but you see these issues often so you can consider this a weak part of the game.

Otherall it's still a fun game, the large alien planet is an enjoyable place to explore but a game is the sum of it's parts and it's not solid throughout.

Some were complaining about having stamina so you can't run around forever away from enemies. Really? As a casual gamer I want an easy VR experience but I won't even complain about that. This is a VR action adventure shooter with a variety of enemies that attack. Everything is explained at the beginning if you listem instead of staring at the pilot/1st officer the whole time and missing key points like I did. Heh. It isn't revolutionary but it is something we need in VR instead of dopey wave shooters and pvp sims which I rarely play. This game you can roam around which I love. Kind of like a dungeon crawler but in a sci-fi theme and it has a bosses. I only fought one so far. I think this is a good buy for a nice Virtual Reality experience. Graphics = beautiful. Pilot Model= hot. Shooting fairly easy but fun too. Monsters = variety. Feeling of being in another time and place = yes. Boss = has at least one. Variety of weapons = yes. Buy this.

I'm not sure I was too fond of the tutorial checklist you needed to do in order to start the game. I might have missed something but I think you had to finish it in order to start the story? And there were A LOT of things to do. 

Anyways, good game, hope more like it come out in VR.

This is a cracking game. The tutorial is a blast and really trains you in the weapons and gets you ready for the cheesy planet you land on. Gunplay is spot on with a reloading mechanic to it. Inventory management is fluid and intuitive. And the graphics are atmospheric. 

However, one criticism that can be remedied. It cries out for trackpad movement. I hate this teleporting crap. It negates the immersion. Players should be given a choice.

Right, back to the game. I'm gonna wear my Captain Kirk toupee and girdle this time. Wonder if that officer will succumb to my charms if I get a sweat on and rip my shirt?

TL;DR - This game is worth much more than the asking price.  Fantastic weapon handling in a Sci-Fi atmosphere. 

I think I have put enough time into the game to finally give it a review.  I wanted to hold off just in case this game was too good to be true.  Its true.  Its good. 

Think Mass Effect mixed with Crisis and a little splash of Starship Troopers.  The game is no wave shooter.  There are objectives to complete and places to go and explore.  Movement is done with short, fast, dashes that work fairly well.  Hopefully they add more options for locomotion. 
The strongest aspect is defintely the weapons handling.  Pistol, Shotgun, Assault Rifle, Sniper Rifle, Bazooka, they are all here and they are spectacular.  Reloading and actually pulling back the bolt handle before taking my next shot is incredibly satisfying.  Oh and did I mention you also get a Lazer Compound Bow and magic?

Now this game isnt perfect: There are some bugs, some physics issues (some enemies go flying 20' after being shot for some reason), and I have had to restart the game a couple times.  But the game itself makes me easily overlook these minor flaws.   Probably the worst part of the game is your annoying sidekick.  She could use a bit more animation so her mouth moves with her dialogue.  

All in all, I would have paid double for this game.  I keep referring to myself as Commander Shepard through habit alone, because thats who I feel like.  

I cannot wait to see what this team brings to the final product.  I really really like where its headed already.  This is easily my favorite VR game, hands down.  Because thats what it feels like, a game.  Not a demo, or a wave shooter, or a half-baked idea that may work out.  This is a full game and its fantastic!

Pro Tip - Hold your pinky out on your right hand when reloading the handgun.  This lets me butt the other controller to it when Im reloading instead of smashing the controllers again.  
Oh, and watch overhead clearances - I gave my projector an overhead serve while throwing a grenade.",1489513138,1489513325

However I urge the developers to put more care into their QA process, My game crashed during the final boss fight, AND now refuses to respawn the final boss when loading the save file

I am currently pretty pissed for the game to crash during the final  f***king boss fight and me not being able to keep playing right at the point at which I would have beaten the game. However the fact that I am still recommending it should speak to the games quality. 

Currently everytime you end the game you are unable to restart it because steam believes the game is still running, this woud be acceptable fi the game would not constantly crash causing you to have to reboot your vive headset each time. Ontop of this my game crashed just as I was about to beat the final boss, which is now not respawning anymore from my save point and the game is basically broken for me.

Game looks pretty decent, but an annoying thing is that when you plant the explosives it doesn't destroy the door/rock wall on the first charge? takes several it seems. I went back scrounging around for another explosive for about 5 minutes. This is because the movement system is screwed up in this game also. Teleport or locamotion doesn't really matter to me, but the idea that I have to literally wait for 30 seconds for my energy meter to get to full for any type of movement blows arse. Take out the restriction on movement. Noone wants to play a game where you have to wait around for a third of it to be able to move. Also, make it to where you can inject the syringes anywhere and not one particular arm. If i'm shooting with my right. I stop to grab a syringe from a crate then I realize its my left arm that needs to be injected, I have to stop...drop my gun from my right hand and drop the syringe that's in my left hand and grab it off the ground. inject my left arm in the correct spot, then grab my pistol....that's some majorly annoying game mechanics for a setting that should give you more freedom...not load you down with annoying bs.

The enemies are also quite varied. You don’t feel as if the developer made a couple enemy types and then just changed the look a bit and buffed their stats to make different versions.

Its early access and a lot will depend on the speed at which the developer updates and improves the missing elements that will truly make this a polished game but so far they have nailed everything that has been implemented aside from the inventory system. That part is still pretty rough.  He also needs to make it a bit easier to grab ammo clips from your side but overall its minor stuff that needs to be fixed.

I see a lot of people comparing it to arizona sunshine, but I can genuinely say this game is 100x better than arizona sunshine. Even the greatest of games have a lot of kinks to work through though, and this one has quite a few. It is, however, in early access so I'm sure a lot of this will be fixed in time.

First we will start with the good:

1. Great variety of weapons which are all highly useable except the bow, the bow is fun but very difficult to aim naturally because it'll make you accidentally hit your headset. 

2.There is actually a story, there are so few vr games with a story. I do think the story is a bit corny at times with some awkward dialogue, but it's still a great touch.

3. The graphics are AMAZING for a vr game. The first two levels kinda feel like there's something missing in the enviroment like more plantlife and such but after that the game feels very real, so real you'll actually start to get really scared of the bullets flying at you.

4. Smart Ai is such an important thing to have, however, same as the last comment, the ai in the first two levels is a lot dumber than the ai in the later levels, the human ai is very good.

5. A thorough and helpful tutorial.

6. The enemies are extremely diverse, I've only played 4 levels but I've seen so many enemies from bugs to demons to humans.

7. The movement actually moves you to where you point, instead of teleporting you, so for anyone who gets sick from vr games that make you teleport, this is the game for you.

8. Some enemies actually say intelligent things, which is awesome.

9. The price is LESS THAN HALF of what I think the game is worth, so yes, buy it.

10. I love the idea of looking around the enviroment for the passcodes, it adds a lot more depth to the gameplay.

11. I LOVE THE WRISTMAP. When you look at your wrist asnd see a holographic map pop up, it doesn't only look aswesome but it makes you feel awesome.

Now for the negatives, this game is great but there are a lot of things that the game is lacking.

1. Doors take SEVERAL explosive charges before they actually explode, this honestly drives me crazy and I'm not sure if it's supposed to be there or if it's a bug.

2. Some of the enemies are really outlandish looking and it makes it kind of silly, the demon monsters and the alien looking creatures (from alien vs. predator) are bright strange colors, honestly this isn't really that bad, I'm not sure why but it takes me out of the game.

3. The only way I've seen so far to put items in your inventory so far is by DROPPING YOUR PISTOL so you can pick it up, and then you have to pick your pistol back up, this is a HUGE problem especially when you're trying to loot while you're shooting. (This has been fixed)

4. Some of the ai is really bland, most of them are pretty good, but a wider range of noises, dialogue, and having creatures that have more than one attack would be great. The human ai also only shoots two bullets at a time, which I find really predictable, it would be nice if the human ai could shoot a different amount of bullets from time to time. The ai of the female who shows you around in the turorial is also a little janky, her movements are awkward but honestly for early access this is fine.

5. The fact that you have to wait for the ability to move to recharge is a little obnoxious, it's not too bad but being stuck and unable to move is a little ridiculous, a recharging sprint would be a lot more reasonable. 

6. In the beginning I had no idea that the pistol had infinite ammo, so when I ran out of my first clip I started running around being chased by bugs for 20 minutes, it would be nice if there was an infinity sign where the pistol ammunition availability number is.

7. When you're fighting the human enemies they all breath EXACTLY like darth vader, it's funny and all, but this game is very very good and the obvious emmulation of the darth vader breathing noises makes it seem a little ridiculous

8. There are A LOT of grammar errors, there's a log that says ""I hided myself in the gate and sealed"" It should say hid and not hided, there is plenty more examples of grammar mistakes, which could easily be fixed by asking someone to help you fix the mistakes (I'd be glad to help).

Other minor things include
-buggy textures
-no music
-Screen sometimes fades to black for no reason

There is also many things that could be added to make this game better, these are some of my personal suggestions.

1. Weapon upgrades and xp. Having a system where you could level up and get perks or find upgrades for your weapons would make the character want to explore more. It would also add to the replayibility and would be PERFECT for this game.

2. The skeletons all look exactly the same and are always found next to the logs, Instead of skeletons, dead troopers positioned uniquely would really sell the atmosphere better.

3. Scavenging ammo off dead soldiers would also add more depth to the game, though obviously this is not a big deal.

4. Having online play would really sell this game for me, so far the is the only game on VR I have played where the combat was solid, so multiplayer gameplay would be extremely fun.

5. Add more story and more lore, give the main character and the girl they are with a backstory, maybe even integrate the training into the game to make the gameplay more seamless.

6. Add more to the enviroment, the enviroment looks amazing and unique but it could use more to make it seem realistic.

Conclusion: This is the best game on VR BY FAR right now, it has an actual long story with intense combat and great game mechanics, this game gets a solid 9/10 from me, if the things mentioned above are all fixed/added, I would genuinely give this a 10/10. BUY. THIS. GAME.

Vagrant is a boobydvania where you play as a horny blonde with outstanding assets, who fights terrible monsters and saves other damsels in distress with even more outstanding assets. The game definitely does not establish any new standards in graphics or gaming mechanics, but still, it manages to deliver very pleasant visuals and simplistic but exciting gameplay.  The story of Vagrant will hardly shock you, still, it has some drama, a plot twist and even few endings!

From the gameplay perspective - it is 2D hack and slash side scroller. Not very deep, but still fun enough to spend few days. You learn new skill, unlock new abilities, use different deadly combos. If you want to unlock everything - it definitely will require considerable amount of grind. But luckily - there are few good areas where you can easily farm all required resources. Just look at my playtime: pure grind took me probably only 2+ hours. And I can't even say that it was boring. Together with beautiful animations, pleasant sounds and few good soundtracks it was rather fun thing to do as well.

As to the cons - it is a console port. And not the best one. So expect some troubles with controls (or use controller). Luckily, the game is not that hard. I finished it on ""lunatic"" without serious troubles, so this problem wasn't a deal-breaker for me... Ah, yeah, and a word about the price. I've just noticed it - Vagrant is definitely underpriced. In fact, the game delivers more than asks for it.",1616096320,1616096320

The visuals are gorgeous, and the game is solid in all other aspects. The story, while a bit cliche, is decent. For me, the boss battles are the highlight of the gameplay, and you get around 15 of them, most of which are pretty fun. On the flip side, the battles with regular enemies can get repetitive really quickly, and there are some platforming sections in the game that can get pretty frustrating if you get knocked down by an enemy near the top and have to start climbing up from the very bottom again. Aside from that, I feel like the hidden objectives of game could have been executed better.

All in all, while not a masterpiece, the game is a complete side-scrolling action RPG (wouldn't call it a metroidvania, since areas are gated by story instead of ability), and the indie developers did a great job for a small team of 3. Most importantly, I was hooked on the game and had trouble putting it down until I completed it, despite finding some parts frustrating! The game is easily worth thrice its current price, IMO.

I got to the final boss and realized i'm sevearly underleveled and it will take nearly half of the time I spent comepleating the story just to grind to the point  where the last boss will be an enjoyable fight. 

The boss battles were fun but only take up about 25 min of the gameplay. 

so I really enjoyed about 40 min of the 7 hours I put into the game.....I can't reccomend this, sorry devs.  

Also It would have been cool to see good items in shops.....i did not once need anything stocked by a single on of the shops in the game.

The Vagrant has side quests to complete alongside with main that are given by all kinds of characters around the world or found by going through some secrets and harder to reach places. Story was quite good and there's several endings for the game from losing to enemies or getting to the conclusion way or another. Visual/audio were both enjoyable as well, some of the background were not so detailed and blurred in style, but didn't really notice it when was going around and fighting.

Lets start with the basic the controls are good, with no real problems in executions, i used a ps4 controller. Graphics are old school thinking in odin sphere but again see youtube for those things.. same with sound. Now story is enough, is not a master piece and give some things that dont have sense but i had see worst, so story pass. Now the problem and oh boy a lot of times think in give a no recommend and stop play, first i play this game in hard and get normal ending is kinda easy cause in last maps you want all be over, game ask you for explore but dont give any reason for that be worth. Appear places harder that are rift, that ask for a lot of coins and give no good rewards, so why do them.. well for me was challange for rest ... dunno. SOme bossess are a pain that requeires a good trained char and this is were the grind get horrible, i get and pass grind, but grind that give few rewards that only is there for put those hours is  a pain, so after sometime i think.. welll lets play on normal for finish the story and notice you can't skip dialogue or anything... ok decide finish my hard run using more items, and well last boss kill me a lot and see all those scenes was a pain, more horrible that last boss battle. 
SO ok if all is averange and cons are so painfull so why recommend, well is a cheap game that have good controls and if you take it casual you will get distracted for 10-30 hours yup toke 21 hours but cause i did a lot of things that make me lose time with a normal run without mistakes can be finished in 10 hours so at the end is a pasable game, but again for me will be a neutral review 
PD: yup someone give me this game so was free but was not so bad for give a no.. and yup i have give no to some games, even some free, the stress of see some dialogue is less of 1 min so is not game breaking if were 1 min+ of dialogue i will be really thinking in give a no.",1608957235,1608957235

It's incredibly well made, it's gorgeous, the combat feels utterly perfect, boss fights are satisfying, the story is highly engaging for a 2D side-scroller with no voice acting, the atmosphere is immersive, the soundtrack is brilliant, the exploration is rewarding, the secrets are logical without being overly obvious, very little feels copy-pasted considering it's an indie game made by just three people, and the amount of content is kind of mind-blowing with the extra modes and the Rifts (my favourite part) and the large maps and the well integrated mana-skill tree-enchantment-specials metre-economy systems and their relationships to each other.  Just a lovely experience.

I have to be honest, one thing that put me off was the character design.  Most characters look great, especially the enemies.  But the overdone sexuality on display in the previews really made me wonder if the game I was going to get would be developed by serious people for serious players, and not primarily just some kind of borderline pornography.  I'm happy to say that it's an excellent game so far (I think I'm nearing the end of one playthrough), and even though my first impression based on most breasts making up half or more of the women they're attached to was to be sceptical, having my suspicions averted has rarely been so satisfying.

If you enjoy side scrolling, action, hack and slash, 2d, loot, buying new weapons and armor, light rpg mechanics, skill tree upgrades, with a kinda-sorta-but-not-really metroidvania style with an Odin Sphere vibe this is the game for you. And to top it off it has a fantastic soundtrack. And when you finish the game there's new game+ so you can tackle the harder difficulties with all your gear and loot if you wish. I explored just about every room in the game and it took me about 8 hours. 

I don't want to write a huge novel here so I'll get to the metroidvania part- Yes, there's a map that you explore on your own and free to go just about anywhere you want, but unlike a true metroidvania game you won't get certain abilities to get to parts of the map that you couldn't before. As the story progresses, (it's simple and straightforward, but it's paced well and it's pretty good imo), you'll unlock new areas to explore. You'll always get a question mark on the map to show where you need to go next to advance the story, but in the meantime you're free to explore to get gold, Mana, weapons, unlock chests, etc. 

I seriously can't believe this game is just base price at $4. That's an incredible steal alone. Controller support works fine, achievements, trading cards included too. And I got it at a 60% off sale.

The game is way better than I thought, the soundtrack plus the interesting plot and characters makes it so immersive. This is a very satisfying hack&slash with a very simple rpg system, dont get me wrong it is not bad kust simple. The game is not hard anyone can play it.

Update
The game does not disappoint, the combat gets slowly better, the story developed quite well, and it gets harder, boss fights are intense but they are still cheesable, I believe this one thing that the character might be immortal if you have enough resources, if you grind gold and buy food, you can eat them during fights to restore hp and on top of that when you open your inventory the game is paused(this part is the cheese that i mentioned).",1603844007,1605461920

It's a side-scrolling 2D hack-n-slash game (flat sprite-based and 3D mix using the Unreal Engine) with dodging as it's main avoidance mechanic, meaning that it's a delightful mix of combo attacks, jumping and precision dodges that allow you to carve your enemies up like.... well, imagine if the greased-up deaf guy from Family Guy just so happened to be a hyperactive ninja! Smack a baddie a dozen times, deftly dodge untouched from their attack, add 39 more hits to your combo before smashing their face into the ground, and you got this game! At least.... when you can SEE your enemies on-screen, the OFF-SCREEN ONES, however... Then there's the story and characters, which, uh, well....  Get ready to delve into a really depressing world of struggle, deception, hatred, sorrow...  Let's just say, anyone in this world who doesn't die is destined to a life of total abject misery.

Pros:

-Wonderfully designed combat system where, with some practice and some good hand-eye coordination, you can pull off some great slash/dodge/jump combos and carnage that feels so damn satisfying when you wreck a dozen baddies in a 60+ combo without taking a shred of damage! Other examples like this include Neir:Automita or Legacy of Kain: Defiance. Fast, intense, almost artistic... It's like getting the S rank in a Sonic game but in short bursts.
-The art style is really awesome in that the aesthetic looks like watercolor art jumped off of a canvas! Also, the animation reminds me of Castlevania: SotN where the 3D-rendered characters moved differently than the ones that're more like 2D sprite. Dunno what that's called.... 
-There's a fair amount of weapons, armor and items and, as long as you're progressing thru a 'fresh' new game (after beating the game you can replay with all the stuff you got), they're all helpful/useful. Baddies drop weapons/armor/items, but the drops are appropriate to the level/area you find them, meaning that you won't be getting a badass weapon by luck at level 2 and kick the games ass up to level 50.
-The original art creator and/or director were REALLY BIG (ba-dum tish!) on having all the women in the game having huge boobs, exaggerated bodily proportions and being scantily clad (unless they're old). It's the very definition of 'objectification', but it's originally from Japan and it's all par for the course. Yeah, it's annoying in this more PC world, but it's what they do and how they wanna do it. Don't like it? Move on.
-Weapons and armor can be upgraded not just in overall strength, but you can bind Runes to add damage, status effects, elemental effect, a lot like other RPGs.
-Game plays silky smooth on even the crappiest of systems. Anyone should be able to enjoy this game it all its 60fps glory.
-Music is pretty good.

Cons:

-Vivian looks just like Yang from RWBY. There, I said it. Now who's gonna sue who first?
-Vivian yells her attacks, but she repeats them in slightly varying ways, so they aren't as annoying as they could be.
-2D art doesn't realistically flip when you change directions, it just mirrors. Turn Vivian left & right and see how her metal arm magically switches back & forth.  :)
-This game hates you, hates Vivian, and hates everyone and everything within its world, and it wants you to know it. This is a very pessimistic, depressing downer of a game world that, from the onset, is determined to not only crap on the protagonist at every opportunity, but to also dump on every character in the game. Maybe that makes it more 'medival'...?
-As this game uses a dodge mechanic rather than a block mechanic, it not only takes a good amount of coordination to pull off the dodge/slash/jump mechanics, but it also means that getting beat on/combo'd/knocked down is how the baddies pummel on you in return, so get used to that.
-This game is the DEFINITION of D_CK MOVE!!! IT LOOOOOOOOOOOOVES OFF-SCREEN PUMMELING!!! Seriously, there's a few places where you'll walk into a new area and, before you can even look at your surroundings, you're suddenly hit by one or more projectiles from baddies that you CAN see, but then take an off-screen arrow, an off-screen cannonball, an off-screen poisoned projectile, an off-screen dynamite to the face and, as you're trying to get out of the barrage of unfairness, you walk into a fire trap hidden in the floor that knocks you off a ledge into a spear trap that shoots right up your butthole! This game hates you and wants you to know it!
-While an initial play-thru will show that weapon/armor/item progression is nearly on par with story/map progression, after beating the game you can play through again with everything you acquired. Even if you barely scraped thru by the skin of your teeth, your second playthrough with all your stuff will be a cakewalk. Only reason to do it is for completionist reasons.
-*SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!* The protagonist dies, and it's rather sad how she goes in many ways. Really. As much as I love this game and I really like everything about the combat, design, art and everything involving gameplay, the story is done and Vivian has run her course. If there's even a hint of a sequel, they're pulling it entirely out of their ass. This game HATES you and wants you to know it!
-The in-game store economy is... so friggin stupid, and yet, maybe if I did my research, possibly entirely accurate? Here's what I mean: Weapons and armor at shops range anywhere from 'affordable' to 'WHAT THE $#*@% ARE YOU THINKING!?!?!?!' As a top-of-my-head example, let's go with this scenario to basically describe ALL the shops in this game!  Let's say I walk into a weapons shop with 10,000 gold in hand. The blacksmith has 4 weapons, and here are the prices: Sword 1, 3000g Sword 2, 7500g Sword 3, 15,000g Sword 4, 55,000,000g!  OK, maybe this really expensive sword is really, REALLY good, and only they have it!  No, you can either find that expensive sword in a chest a little ahead of where you are, or you can find it in a baddies drop slightly further beyond that. As if that wasn't bad enough, every weapon available for sale can be found in chests or on baddies. All of them. WORSE YET, the only weapons in the game worth a crap can only be found, not bought, making the listings of the weapons in the stores... ENTIRELY POINTLESS! THIS GAME HATES YOU AND WANTS YOU TO KNOW IT!!!!!!!!
-Dialogue is well translated, but there are a few lines with grammar/spelling/punctuation issues.

Don't get me wrong, this is a really good game, bordering on great in select areas, but the game wants to make you as miserable as possible and it does it with traps & off-screen pummeling. The combat/action/story/unique characters, as well as the weapon/armor upgrade system, it has all the makings of an amazing game! But it has a lot of things that really drag it down, and I could see people disliking it for that. Then there are the special snowflakes that'll hate the game for its depiction of (younger) women. I really like it, but I can totally get why people would also hate it.",1602250132,1602250132

The Vagrant is a Metroidvania Style Game that tells the story of Vivian, a Mercenary searching for her past. The graphics and gameplay somehow resembles classics like Odin Sphere with it's vibrance and colorfulness. 

The gameplay started well and good, but got borish by the end game and NG+. The difficulties are balanced, as is the loot, gear and skill progression.

The story was predictable, but had some interesting twists. 

Would have been interesting to see the complete game, as this was a failed kickstarter project IIRC. The dev made a good job with what resources he got his hands on.

Buy it full price if possible, as the game is cheap and fun enough to justify it.

Where else do you get hit and fly as far as you did in Ninja Gaiden of the 90s. 2018, they came out with dodging in the air  to go past the irritating Medusa and arrows.
Imagine Dark Souls 3 when Pontiff Sullivan speaks to you in Japanese while fighting. It's as cool as Dragons speaking Japanese in Dragon's Dogma. Even though the developer is Chinese. It's still a decent work with some Japanese VA.
It's similar to Golden Axe whereby you hack and slash without thinking about taking pantsu shots when jumping. Because they made it permanently bikini so that you don't have to think anymore and just focus on chopping enemies into half.
There is a skill tree locked behind collectibles which prevent you from overpowering yourself to make progression a 1Hit KO like FFX but even better as you don't have to spend hours redesigning/calculating which node gives you the most gain just to learn Zanmato is the best.
The equipment RNG is great as well, you pick up a myriads of swords and each time you get one it's totally different making you want to open the menu and look at it. Seriously, there are games whereby you don't even want to look at the inventory because you predicted crappie crawled into your inventory.
You can even run without doing backdash-down-backdash-down to travel faster. Your sword is also able to destroy spikes without the need to find a hidden armor. (I still admire Iga's work though) 
Best bug in this game is that when you kneel down and go into menu, after releasing the down button, exiting the menu gives you very fast walking/running speed. It's a little easter egg instead of a bug to me.
Even the story presentation and map design reminds me of Valkyrie Profile.
This is my 2nd hour and I love this game. All the Nostalgic vibes from those titles I mentioned, the price don't do it any justice and there is no microtransaction involved in getting all stuff ingame. 
The game just gets better than Dynasty Warriors combo system the more you play because there is a larger variety of commands than that after unlocking.

After completing in 10hrs,
This game has new game+, with a maxed character, you could easily run through everything on Very Hard in 2.5hours. I completed the game in 10hours. There dialogue isn't much but you can roughly estimate exploring makes up about 75% of the game (inclusive of bonus dungeon and optional bosses). There isn't a level to grind or any need to buy from shop if you do explore. But getting the Achievement related to 1 mil Mana and Gold is likely to take you longer than a playthrough.

Everyone that enjoy Metroidvania should play this and appreciate the amount of work put into making this hidden gem. It's like a sunflower to an Otaku. Lastly, if you want challenge, play this in Very Hard mode the first time round without carrying over stats/equipment from NG+.
Avoid Lunatic mode unless you enjoy getting one shotted. There are save points before boss room <3",1601476533,1601614930

The Vagrant is a fairly solid metroidvania, but it's nothing that really stands out ~ in its pros or its cons.

In general, it's not particularly difficult (I played through on Very Hard, for whatever that's worth to you) and apart from a few instant kill attacks, the game felt pretty fair for the most part. Some of the bosses take the [spoiler]censored[/spoiler] but it never felt too ridiculous, imo.

It's not going to be the best game you've ever played but, if you enjoy metroidvanias anyway, you'll have a good time with this.
Also, +points to the devs for selling this for a price that's actually worth it ~ there aren't many games on Steam that I wouldn't recommend waiting for a sale on, but this is one of them. A good time, for a low price.

76561198812838651,598700,True,0,0,0,127,126,171,120,"This game is the definition of a rough diamond.
The potential is there: the art is great, the concept is nice and the story could be rewritten into something interesting.
However, at the end of the day, it falls short on so many things that the only reason i could have to actually recommend it is the low price.

The controls are responsive and you never feel like the character won't do what you want her to do, but the movement is clunky, jumping has zero mobility, and dodging is the only reliable way to reposition yourself. For a game that seems to focus on action, the fact that whenever you attack an enemy you're bound to the ground where you're standing, and the only way to work around is to dodge -thus breaking your chance deal consistent damage- feels underwhelming.

Enemies are rarely dangerous as their damage is negligible, but it's incredibly frustrating to fight because the second yo enter a room all the present enemies (including those that you can't see) commence their attack. This means you can get stunlocked right after walking into a new place, and will keep getting hit by random arrows or cannonballs until you find where the ♥♥♥♥ that guy is. The same applies to traps: they're not dangerous, they won't kill you, they simply slow you down by making you wait for Vivian to get up for the umpteenth time.

The weapon upgrade system is a thing that exists, yet not even once have I felt the need to use it. Runes are a less common drop than equipment, including fully upgraded pieces. Also, the buying prices for anything that's not uncooked food are absolutely outrageous, making money mostly useless. So is cooking, by the way. It's easier to buy the one cooking recipe with the bonus that you need and, since it lasts forever, there's no reason to ever cook unless you're really desperate to heal yourself, in which case it's still better to just eat the ingredients raw as they're really abundant. By the way, it'd be nice to have some way to know which food buff we have active, I really have no idea if I ever actually got buffed or not because there's no indication whatsoever.

Why do bosses have a level? We can't gauge the bosses' strength by their level since Vivian doesn't have a level herself to compare to. I've fought a lvl 25 boss, then a lvl 40 boss and then a lvl 50 boss with pretty much the same equipment, and the only thing that made a difference on difficulty was their moveset, not their damage or their HP, so I don't see the point.

On the matter of bosses, their AI is stupid or non-existant. Mobile bosses can be cheesed by constantly dodging to their backs with almost zero consequences, but immobile bosses like the undead king or the statue are incredibly annoying to kill because their moveset is fully composed of attacks that make you wish you'd be away from them, and since your only way to fight is on melee, they become slow and annoying. The undead king is notoriously bad because its difficulty is directly related to how much he decides to spam certain skills instead of others, or how often he suddenly stops attacking altogether and becomes a puchingball instead.

Traversing the maps is also quite bothersome due to random locked fights that serve no purpose. Locked fights in certain games exist to introduce new enemies, to force you into fighting under certain conditions, or to make sure you are weakened before reaching a cetain place. In the Vagrant, locked fights are just random, they have no reason to exist. Most of the time you'll be stuck fighting the same wolves and rats you've already killed a few dozen times before. Sometimes locked fights will trigger again if you go through the same place before activating a specific event. Sometimes the game will lock you in a fight against a deer that doesn't even attack you, like, why am I forced to kill this random, innocent animal? What's the lesson here? What's the point? It's not hard to kill them, they don't give good loot, they're just there and you can't keep walking until you kill them. Why?

Writting is all over the place. The english translation is awkward, but even if it was proper, dialogue feels forced and bland. The cutscene when the wizard girls gets to the void is specially weird, the transitions make no sense and the action isn't properly conveyed at all, the same applies to the next cutscene with about Vivian's father. I couldn't make heads nor tails out of it.

Can the game still be enjoyed? Sure, I guess. It works, and even though there's a few bugs here and there, none of them are game-breaking (I did have to restart the game once due to the undead king sending my off-screen). The art is great, the music is kind of there and level design is not entirely bad (there's a couple of dungeons with levers/buttons and doors that give zero information on what you just did, that could be worked on) and the controls are responsive enough, so it's not a complete waste of a game. Still there's much to work and polish before it can be considered actually good.

Edit: Also, why would you make double jump a requisite to advance through certain places, and at the same time an optional upgrade that you can easily miss if you don't check every single upgrade available? That's some really, really terrible game design. Players who get to a certain point without double jump will be forced to grind for mana only to buy it and be able to advance. If it's a mandatory thing to have, then don't make it an optional ability purchase.",1600400171,1607139020

The Vagrant is a 2D action game, there is a bit of RPG and backtracking, but not much.
Here are some things that I liked about the game:
- Graphics and the artstyle are really cool
- The combat is not as fluid as something like Hollow Knight, but It is good
- Enemy attacks are easy to predict and dodge (except for those stupid slimes)
- The plot is easy to follow, not the most interesting story in the world, but It does the job
- Setting your spells is like making a smash bros character

Here are some negative stuff:
- This game reminds me of some old NES games where you jump on a plataform and you get throw to the other side of the map by a single enemy hit (like in Ninja Gaiden or Castlevania)
- Negative status effect, holy fucking shit, you get poisoned/burned a lot in this game, and removing those status is really annoying, you have to pause -> item -> consumable -> scroll -> antidote -> yes, It gets old really fast
- Money is worthless, everything in the game cost too much, you will endup finishing the game without buying a single weapon

I dont know if the dev will read this, but here are some simple UI/UX problems that you should avoid in your next game

- While shopping the player should see how many of the Item he already has, It is hard to keep track of how many of each potion/ingredient you have
- The hp/rage bar should give more information, adding numbers would help the player know which spell he can cast, If the number are clustering the interface you can change to simple partitions every 100 or something
- The default option in the main menu should be ""Load Game"" after you create your first save file
- When you save/load the cursor should select the most recent save file by default, this avoid overwriting/loading the wrong file
- The game is full of pop-up boxes with ""Yes/No"" options that do nothing, like ""The road to X is open"", It doesnt make sense to show ""Yes/No"", and It is confusing to the player
- The only way to check which recipes you know is by checking in a campfire, This looks like an oversight to me
- Another problem with making food is that you cant see what is your current ""Meal Bonus"", maybe a simple icon on the pause menu would be enough

tl;dr: Overall this is a game with a bunch of flaws, but nothing deal breaker, If you like 2D action games give It a try

It’s safe to say that I’m the target audience for this game. Not for the immediately obvious reason, but because if there is something missing in my life, it’s Vanillaware games on PC. I would pay good money for Odin Sphere and Dragon’s Crown (and that other one that nobody played because it was on the Wii U) to appear around these parts. Alas, one has to make due, and that’s where ""The Vagrant"" comes in.

The... inspiration...  is rather direct and a bit shameless, to the point of copying, and it makes me wonder if some assets have been directly ripped. I swear the skeletons are basically the same as the Sorcerer’s minions from Dragon’s Crown. Also there is a... somewhat off-putting attempt at making the game look Japanese, but it definitely feels (and factually is) Chinese. The voice over being in Japanese caught me off-guard. Anyway... If the game was bad it would be easy to disregard it as one more in an avalanche of shovelware asset-flips that have infiltrated Steam in the last few years.

But Vagrant is actually really good. The combat is tight and satisfying, ramps up nicely in difficulty, the bosses are interesting and provide adequate challenge, due to their hit-boxes being relatively different you have to adapt tactics and the same attack doesn’t work in all bosses, so you have to explore your ability arsenal; level design is good, albeit more complex than I was expecting; I was looking for a beat ‘em up a la Dragon’s Crown where the geography doesn’t really play much of a role, but this is 100% Metroidvania (which is right there in the tags, so that’s on me for not noticing) with tight platforming and tech jumps that require you to be precise and deliberate. I really enjoyed it and thought the secrets were very organic to discover, for the most part. Explore the map and you’ll find stuff. It’s very rewarding.

Definitely recommend it overall. While it lacks some polish, the action is great and that’s what keeps me coming back.",1596760394,1596761552

The reality however is that the game broke several ""unwritten rules"" of a good start gor a game of that genre. Out of the bat, performance is atrocious, i had to crank it all the way to 720 and low and i still could not beat 50 fps on the prologue area, i would expect that tuning it down would make a game that looks like this run on any machine, it doesnt look graphically expensive by any means and i can only blame it on poor optimization and it becomes apparent later on. 

Second comes the controls (i usualy play this type of games with a ps4 controler), right of the bad i realize the dodge is by default mapped to R2 (LT on the xbox controller) and thats a choice that always bothers me, dodging atacks is almost always a precision action, makes sense to want the most precise control used for that, most buttons are fine and up to preference, i personaly prefere the circle (B on the xbox) but i would absolutely never put it on a trigger, triggers have weird feedback, are prone to being activated a little bit by accident (it happened to me alot in skyrim back in the ps3, i would shout at civilians all the time and get myself arrested, overall a bad choice for button mapping).

Adding to the controls problem, the basic combo is a 4 atack combo, but stringing the inputs together is finicky and most of times wont work unless i spamm square as fast as i can, which is just stupid, it really need to feel good and ""snappy"" if im going to do that a lot throughout the game, adding even further to the problem, the animations seem very stiff, lock you in place for what seems to be way too long and the strong attack is even slower and clunkier, makes combat feel real fucking bad out of the bat in the prologue and thats not a good sign, i think combat will be a big focus of the game but i cant be bothered.

After the prologue is finished i arrive at a beach and there is a npc ""being attacked"" by a big pig, except the pig does nothing, walks right past me and didnt try to attack me once, i figured i could just walk past but no, the game locks you in that room until you kill the pig, i can only imagine its AI broke, not a good look to the game.

lots of meaningless dialogue and tutorial popups teaching me how to walk (lol) im finaly free. in that room, what seems to be the insides of a house, the game is running at 60 fps, great, except upon pressing the dodge buttom the game stutters massively (talk about optimization issues) and makes combat quite literaly unplayable, i could only laugh at what a garbage fire this game has been for its 15 minutes or less i played it and decided to refund.

As the cherry on top of the cake, the fact that every single female npc i encountered has juggs bigger than their heads (including the protagonist) makes it look like the devs are trying to sell big boobs to hide the flaws of the game, i felt a bit insulted, but thats just me.

In short, i cant recommend this game to anyone that has a low end pc and/or is not impressed by big anime breasts.",1596150506,1596150506

This game doesn't know how to handle difficulty, it goes with the lazy route, that being padding the health and damage of the enemies. This is alright in the start of the game when most mobs enter a state of stunlock when hit, but becomes a more notable issue when you encounter groups of enemies that only stagger when hit by a heavy attack, or sometimes not at all. It's annoying but doable, up until one boss.  The second to last boss is both grossly difficult and notably unfun when playing on such a high difficulty. It takes almost a minute just to open it up to attack, and once you do you take about 1/8 off of the first of it's three life bars. As soon as I saw this i uninstalled the game. I can deal with difficulty, but not with games that substitute waiting for difficulty. If you're willing to play this game on a lower difficulty it might be worth a purchase, it is pretty cheap after all. I might come back and play it on a lower difficulty some day, but even then it will at most be mediocre.

Additionally, the game has an amazing soundtrack and I even listen to it on occasion on Spotify.

The downsides of the game is that there's some cheap ways to beat the game easily, cheap ways to die, and lots of grinding when it comes to it. I came across this game also to expect a Metroidvania, but I wouldn't really call it that, but I guess there's backtracking in certain areas that grant you new paths upon getting new moves and progressing through the story.

The Vagrant is a sidescrolling hack-n-slash RPG. The closest comparisons would be Odin's Sphere or Dragon's Crown (at least visually). However, the emphasis here is primarily on the hack-n-slash, while the RPG is most evident in the story and its multiple endings. (There are RPG elements, but they feel... tacked on.)

[h1]Not a Metroidvania[/h1]
The label I take issue with is ""Metroidvania,"" because at no point do you gain any abilities that ""open up the map."" 99% of the places you can visit, you can visit almost immediately. And there's no reason to visit older areas, unless you missed something.

It's functional and there is enjoyment to be had if you're itching for some sidescrolling action, smashing some giant boss enemies and the whole upgrading deal.

I can't believe how cheap this game is. I half-expected a plain budget title quickly thrown together for a quick buck - and it was on 60% off sale no less. It's practically under-priced!

Going in I didn't expect much more than some nice titillation and solid aesthetics, and while that's all true I found the rest of the game pretty compelling too. I'll start by putting out some obvious criticism that I feel need to be pointed out:

1) There are some obvious texture layer pop-in happening very frequently in some later areas in the game, particularly in the snowy regions. It seems such an obvious hiccup that I'm surprised it wasn't fixed.
2) The text UI for the speech bubbles were clearly not adjusted for the English language and you can see them constantly growing and shrinking on each side as the text fills in and it looks unpolished.
3) The lack of any helpful i-frames, whilst useful when you're hitting combos, led to more than one instance where 1-3 enemies hit-stunned me to death and I had no time to react with either healing or dodging out of it (which didn't feel at all possible).
4) Some ranged enemies seem to have a funny idea to attack me far off-screen before I've even registered that they exist. I'm all for added challenge, but considering the damage they deal later in the game it becomes something of an issue that I cannot even anticipate their attacks.

Now the game is gorgeous, which is obvious just looking at the store page. The sound track is pretty good too. On occasion perhaps not what I'd imagine it should be, but still good nonetheless. The boss battles are all interesting and unique, and challenging you in cool ways. The levelling up upgrading system in place is pretty comprehensible and offers you a good chance to personalise your preferred style (within the limits of a hack-and-slash).

It’s not very deep, but it’s not bad to scratch a quick hack and slash side scroller itch.  You do combos with fast attacks and power attacks, and there are probably like 6-8 different ones with directional/timing changes.  About 8 skills none of which are super creative, but they are satisfying to use.  They are basically all some form of AoE.  Itemization is kinda weird, with item drops seeming random in strength.  The story ended up being decent for an 8-10 hour game.

This may sound like a bad review, but the gameplay was pretty fulfilling.  The bosses are cool and all pretty unique.  I’d say the boss fights are where the game shines.  Grind at time  to buy enough potions and get a  few more skills until you can beat each one.   Enemies/objects drop gold and XP in satisfying amounts.  It rewards exploration of side rooms while remaining pretty linear.  I’d say it’s a very good buy for $4 but I wouldn’t pay much more than that.

Pros:
- Low price tag at 4$
- Beautiful graphics
- Steam Achievements
- Steam Trading Cards
- Multiple difficulties

Cons:
- Horrible keyboard controls you really need a controller which I don't have. Some of the platforming later on just can't be done with a keyboard.
- Meh music. It fits but it's nothing special
- Unnecessary fluff content like cooking included just to try and fluff the game out and make it longer than it is. 
- Upon first launch you can't access the menu to change the volume until you've completed part of the tutorial. 

Other Info:
- The game appears to be very short
- Game play is a cross between a beat-em-up and Metroid-vania. 

Opinion:
 Due mainly to the keyboard controls I almost can't recommend this game It's clearly designed with consoles in mind and very little thought was put into the controls. The graphics are nice and the story is alright if mostly predictable. The 4$ price tag gives the game a pass on PC as I imagine it will cost much more on consoles.

Still would only recommend it discounted, tho.

->Controls [8/10]: responsive, no big flaws here. Used xbox one controller and it went mostly smoothly.

->Level design [5/10]: it changes a lot through the game, in earlier stages it's great and mostly fluid. However on later 
 stages the plataforms and enemies placement are very frustrating. Even as a person used to metroidvanias and 
 platformers it can be annoying!

->Enemies [4/10]: in early game it's great, but in later game their placement and combination can lead to very annoying 
 stunlocks, knockbacks and repeating the heroine's voice. Even worst during the extra challenge modes, which have 
 some double bosses, bosses with many, many minions... not good. Also for some reason, they imagined that making 
 enemies spawn their ranged attacks out of your screen was a good idea.  Same for making some enemies and bosses 
 spam their attacks, making it harder but also annoying (yes, having to use this word a lot, sadly).

->Soundtrack [6/10]: mostly bland. It fits, but it's not remarkable.

->Progression [7.5/10]: good in the early game, but later game it gets flawed, since there many enemies don't spawn 
 mana. Plus some bosses don't drop the reward chests. But it can be farmed... so nothing too bad.

->Character customization [8/10]: You can equip a weapon, an armor and an acessory. It's little but fits the game well. 
 The item improvement system is ok, but the random damage/armor of items can be weird. Regarding the appearance, 
 the only thing that will change is the sword you use. So even with a heavy suit you'll still look like an oversexualized 
 woman with too little clothes (I'll leave the immersion and good sense vs sexy for you to decide).

->Translation [9/10]: I hardly ever play translated games into PT-BR, but this case was a good exception. The translation 
 covered almost the whole game and was very cohesive. Still, you should know some very basic english as to cover parts 
 like the stats sidebar.

->Graphics [9/10]: pretty neat and don't require a great PC to run it well! Well, just could use better animations here and 
 there. Also, I didn't see nudity in a whole gameplay, only sexualized characters.

->Plot [7.5/10]: fits a short game, it's not bad but and it has some personality, but doesn't go deep.

->Endings[?/10]: I got too annoyed on late game levels to think of trying it again! Still, there are some steps that are 
 misseable and lock the true ending... which ain't quite good.

->Voice acting [3/10]: almost doesn't apply. It has only some very short sentences in japanese. But we can overlook this, 
 doesn't do too much bad for the game IMO.

--> DLCs[?/10]: not purchased, but they are only for art content, so it won't impact the game.

With all that said, if you're a fan of metroidvanias and want to try this game out, aware of the flaws I mentioned above, get it discounted and you won't regret it!",1590979931,1590979931

These days we seem to be swimming in 'Metroidvania's'. Some are excellent, some are bad. The Vagrant is good, but has a few nitpicks you should be aware of. TLDR: Buy, but wait for a sale if you're unsure.

[b]What's this game?[/b]
The Vagrant is a Metroidvania style game, where you traverse platforming levels, fight bosses and revisit some areas once you have a new skill to obtain hard to reach items. Trick is, its not a regular one. Its got good music, beautiful graphics that seem a little inspired by Valkyrie Profile, an interesting upgrade constellation and some interesting boss designs. On the flipside: the controls aren't as tight as I'd like, the voice acting is a bit weird, a lot of enemies are variants, some things like breaking floorspikes give slowdown and the story is a bit... offkey and delivered in a confused manner. Almost as if the devs brought in Hideo Kojima and fed him spacecake till he nearly floated off before giving advice to them in a language they only half understood.

On average though, it is a very enjoyable game with some... thought put into the achievements. It has its flaws, as noted above, but I'd still recommend it. Even at full price.",1590185848,1590185848

Pros:
+It is an imitation of a Vanillaware 2D slasher, with gameplay better than actual Vanillaware games had before their updated re-releases.
+While art/graphics are not as good as in actual Vanillaware games, they are miles better than those of the vast majority of 2D indie games. The game is pleasant to look at.
+Music is also decent.
+About 12-15 hours of content (you may have spend more time with the game, but mostly if you need to grind to the max to beat everything), which is not great, but not bad either.

Not sure:
=Plot and characters are decent enough, but do not reach the heights of Vanillaware games. They may be hampered by one of the cons below.

Cons:
-Difficulty curve could be better. I've played on Hard, and while most of the game past early levels was decently challenging, hard enough to demand proper tactics instead of buttonmashing, but forgiving plenty of errors in execution, at the end you face a gauntlet of three bosses, with no opportunity to save between them, and stats jacked to the point where many of their attacks can one-shot a character who reached that point with relatively few problems.
-Platforming sections at the final level are pretty badly designed, with plenty of deadly flying enemies in the game where you have very limited aerial maneurability and attack capability, and attacks coming from beyond the screen that stagger you and knock you out of your jumps.
-Translation is pretty bad, with obvious errors. To what extent this hinders the plot's presentation I can only guess.

Like the fact that you can open up a map or the fact you can level up the first node in your ability tree 10 times.

The first two hours are pretty difficult, but once you begin building up a better arsenal of weapons and runes, the game becomes a bit more balanced. The endgame gets harder again (naturally) but it still feels fair by the time you get there. The crafting systems are fun, and an integral part of the overall experience. Grinding is generally fun and easy enough to do, but the game seems somewhat stingy with the money drops from time to time. There are also a few spots with some cheap enemy placement, but if you're more liberal with your abilities, you can clear these out pretty quickly. Control is good, as long you keep the animation frames in mind. 

The visual design, in its entirety, is terrific. Similar to Dragon's Crown, everything looks like a painted storybook come to life. The design of the main character notwithstanding, it's not overly fanservice-y. The enemies look like they belong with the locales, and the items are perfectly fantastic in their balance of realism and exaggeration.

- Graphics are great for the most part, yet you can feel other parts are rushed.

Meaning that being aggro by a bunch of flying and running enemies always ends up in the player being combo'd even though theywere properly spacing and timing their attacks. One cannot interrupt enemies even though the player is inflicting combo damage to them. This was the most disturbing part.
- the plot is confusing... especially the last quarter. Felt rushed and improperly presented. I got the true ending, still I am left with the impression that the whole adventure does not really make any sense.

Battling consists of mashing the same button over and over, with an occasional heavy attack sprinkled in. The highest difficulty is not actually that difficult, but then there is the occasional monster party that just instantly kills you with some well timed barrage of attacks before you can even react. The save points are haphazardly placed, meaning you can lose up to 30 minutes of progress by an unfortunately put together monster party.

Even putting aside the boring battling, the visuals of the game are all over the place. Every female character has an impossibly large rack, and the game makes sure to display that properly. It is hard to respect the battles the main character fights if she decides to go to battle with only a bikini for protection - armor you put on does not change the character visually, so for all intents and purposes, she is always half naked. The visuals of the characters clash with the background, which makes looking at this game a pain in most areas. The level design is awful; the game is often very vertical, with a lot of required platforming. However, not only is your character extremely slow most of the time, but the developers made sure to make platforming even more annoying with flying respawning enemies that have no other purpose than to annoy you, statues that attack you on the edge of platforms and so on. 

Fighting enemies nets you mana, which you can put into a skill system. Sadly, there is not much freedom here and the upgrades are boring - a little bit of damage here, some defense there. Sometimes you can make your special attacks a bit stronger or make them cost less rage, but overall, it is hard to feel the impact of the ability development. The game also intends you to grind a lot because money is extremely sparse and strong equipment costs A LOT. The story is also not that amazing, though I guess for a game where everything is all over the place, it is perhaps the most consistent and inoffensive aspect.

So really, this game is not all that fun. Fighting consists of pressing the same buttons over and over, enemy parties are random and as such battling is as much up to luck as it is to skill, and the level design is some of the worst I have ever seen in any video game. I advise to stay far away - there are MUCH better vanillaware games. The only saving grace is the passable music.",1582061842,1582061960

The fighting system is similar to a 2D fighting game and is mostly well balanced. The difficulty of the fights was good for me on hard setting. Only frustrating part are areal battles which are not harder but often require more time. It's the first game in some time where I did all endgame content because it gets you the best equipment and makes the final battle very easy. The endgame and non required content provides some challenge but is not too frustrating so that it would make you stop playing.
To increase your stats there is no level system but an ability board, weapons, armour and potions. There is also special skills you can use, but they are a bit unbalanced, so there are only a few very useful.
Overall I really treasure this game as it was a fun ride. I think you can play it in about 10h. For getting the best equipment and a full ability board I played on hard setting about 16h. I'm a bit sad that it was not longer, because there are features that come in short and have much more potential. The system of this game could have easily been used for a 40h+ game.

Exploration is a boring chore, locations are boring and lack detail. Maybe don't aim to replicate vanillaware artstyle if you don't have what it takes. 
Combat is also absolute joke. Some enemies have unreadable animations for their attacks that get further obscured by various effects. Combo system is extremely dull with 0 variety to it even after you get some upgrades. Castlevania games get by with most weapons just having one or two attacks tops by giving enemies a lower health pool so combat becomes more about exploiting openings. In Vagrant you end up stunlocking most enemies and occasionally dodging only to continue stunlocking them.
There's also extraordinary amount of stupid cheap shit in this game. Traps that hit you off screen, enemies that fire projectiles that hit you off screen. Bosses that have RNG attacks that can end up stunlocking you. All their patterns are essentially the same so every boss fight feels roughly the same. Get close, slam attack until they enter attack animation, dodge, repeat.
I couldn't be bothered to waste any more time on this game after the count fight. A drawn out, piece of shit of a fight that forces you to peck the boss with tiny attacks as he does attacks that deplete half your lifebar. Most of this game is an exercise in patience rather than any sort of skill.

[b]TL;DR[/b]: ""A short and sweet [i]mertroid-vania[/i]-style hack-and-slash that plays well and is fun for the [b]18 hours[/b] (more or less) you'll spend on it.""

[b]FYI[/b]: I 100%'d the game on my first run in 22 hours exactly and finished a new game plus to get all the achievements I missed in 1 hour and 49 minutes. A total time of [u]23:49[/u].

[b]STORY[/b] - [u]TL;DR[/u]: The story is okay. It's passible, but there are some hiccups, here and there, that should have been addressed or taken out. I will say 90% of it works and everything makes sense until the last 3 minutes of the game which make you say... what? Obviously, this part was rushed and probably is the result of a bad translation. All-in-all, decent.

[b]GAMEPLAY[/b] - [u]TL;DR[/u]: Good enough, fast, fun, will hold your attention. It's your standard sword/magic hack and slash. Nothing to write home about, but I give them major credit for the ease-of-learning, the general feel, and the precision. Many games can nail the first two, but if you don't nail precision, your game feels like a drunk Castlevania. It's not winning any awards, but I never really felt like too much wasn't my fault.

[b]BUT...[/b] Honestly, the game was too easy. It has 5 difficulty settings and while playing on hard (lvl 3) was fun, it was by no means challenging... excluding the secret dungeon, of course. Even new game plus on lunatic (lvl 5) was ridiculously easy. All the difficulty seems to do is make the enemies deal more damage... BUT... I'd rather have too easy, than egregiously hard and unfair like some other indy titles. This game was fun, so I give it a pass.

Unfortunately, there is the downside to the combat in that one move in the game [b]COMPLETELY[/b] wrecks [b]EVERY[/b] boss. I wish that was fixed as the final boss was a cake walk, even on Insane mode.

Now, for the [u]elephant-in-the-room[/u]. So many reviews and forum posts are angry at this game's ""art"" direction. Honestly... I'm sorry, but I don't have a problem with it. This is because as an anime fan, I've grown desensitized to over-exaggeration of female anatomy. This is a common trope in anime and while it seems in your face, at first, it is not used beyond the simple act of character design. The women in this game have large breasts and butts, but they are not brought up nor are they shoved in your face at any point. I understand many finding this unappealing, but I stand behind the artists. If they want attractive women in their game, let them put them in and let the market decide if that's what gamers want.

BUT... I do want to give them credit as the main character is not just given large anatomy. In this story, at nearly all points she is made out to be strong, independent, and courageous. She is still given human weaknesses and fears, but she is not made to be this intense sex symbol beyond her looks. In fact, she is the toughest character in the game, even sporting her own 8-pack. You heard me ""EIGHT""-pack. I think we need to relearn not to be afraid of sexualizing and objectifying characters as long as they’re not made to JUST be sex objects. After all, [b]Lara Croft[/b], [b]Wonder Woman[/b], [b]Tifa Lockhart[/b], [b]Kitana[/b], [b]Jill Valentine[/b], and the ENTIRE [b]DOA[/b] cast are all extremely attractive women, but who all kick major butt and have their own deep and personal stories to tell. The only shame in objectifying is that that is all you do to the character.

Overall, I greatly enjoyed [u]The Vagrant[/u]. My only disappointment is that... [b]I wish there was more[/b]. BUT... in the end, that is how the best games should make you feel.",1581488864,1581488864

Contrary to how Vivian is dressed in some of the preview screenshots on the Steam store page, there is no sexy content at all in the game; the most titillation you're gonna get is the generous amounts of cleavage most of the female characters display. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 

The combat is pretty much standard 2D hack-and-slash with a combo system using light and strong attacks. Dodging doesn't require stamina or cooldown so you can spam dodge; unfortunately the invulnerability frame for dodging is extremely small so it's near impossible to dodge through enemy attacks. Using skills does make Vivian invincible for the duration of the skill animation but requires Rage as a resource and is extremely slow to build. The boss battles are insanely tedious due to the bosses' insane HP pool and annoying attacks. Even on normal difficulty, the first boss is near impossible to beat. 

Another big part of the game is platforming. The game's platforming sections are extremely frustrating to go through due to the endless spawning of flying enemies, traps and environmental hazards.

Thankfully, trainers exist for this game so if you just wanna have a stressfree, enjoyable experience and focus on the story and exploration, I highly recommend using a trainer to give yourself infinite HP and infinite rage to be able to spam skills (this also lets you use aerial movement skills to reach hidden sections more easily). Trainers will greatly help with the frustrating platforming sections though it still requires patience and skill.

Exploration is greatly rewarding as there are plenty of hidden passages and treasures to be found. The game has a good map function and decent fast travel system. Controls are intuitive and responsive with a controller which is highly recommended for this game.

Vivian herself is dressed in incredibly sexy bikini armor showing off her enormous chest assets and leave you fantasizing about what's underneath that tiny strip of fabric between her legs. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) The character artwork is the biggest reason to play this game. Plenty of the female NPCs have massive breasts and show lots of cleavage. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Unfortunately, there is an unrealistic lack of breast physics in this game. Vivian's breasts barely jiggle no matter how much she moves and jumps around.

I highly recommend this game if you like 2D action RPGs with attractive female characters. The gameplay is extremely frustrating and difficult even on normal but is easily solved with the use of trainers and the abundance of cleavage on display ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) throughout the game is definitely worth it. The game can be completed in under 10 hours and is worth the cheap price tag.",1580986885,1581395724

The game is a lot of fun if you're looking for simple combat/platform mechanics and/or you like the idea of growing from a peasant that deals 1 damage per attack to wolves at the beginning of the game to a demigod that dishes out tens of thousands of dps  to big armored demons by the endgame.

A must buy if you like Vanillaware's art style, which this game is obviously inspired by. The backgrounds and most characters are gorgeous and I enjoyed seeing them again during ng+

The only truly negative thing that I feel like saying is that aerial combat is janky at best and frustrating at worst. This will make the (admitedly not many) very long vertical rooms even longer because some random projectile knocked you off from the top and you had no way to recover before tumbling down to the bottom. Also because of this, if your dps is not good enough, certain flying enemies from late game onward will be a chore to fight.

Pros:
+ Good combat, feels more precise than actual vanillaware titles 
+ Art is up to snuff - it looks really nice if you're in to that aesthetic
+ Music is also good - was mixed until the lead up to the throne room
Cons:
- Bugs: No gamebreaking bugs yet but have run in to one major one where I couldn't interact with levers in the catacombs. Going back to a save point and reloading the game fixed.
- Bugs: Enemies would occasionally appear as silhouettes after being hit where not intended.
- Bugs: Enemies would rarely freeze and do nothing.
- Gameplay: Hitboxes could be more generous (from behind the direction of attack)
- Translation: The English translation is mixed. ""The door is locked"" ""x - yes  o - no"" 
From what I understand the studio behind this game is Chinese, however the limited character voicing is in Japanese. The voice work is all very solid, but some of the menu text can be strange and the text dialouge cab be stilted. 
The combat feels like it's own thing once you've unlocked enough, and flows nicely. 
With the current sales price of 2.4AUD (probably around 1.50 freedombux) it's well worth it. 
Around 2 hours in at time of reviewing and was impressed enough bought a couple of copies for my friends.
Full price would still be impressed. 
Combat _could_ be more precise - there is no parry despite the animation work being good enough to allow that without artifice like light flashes etc. Hitboxes for some enemies can be a bit too wide - red skeletons wind attack can feel a bit cheap. 
The style is derivative for sure, but ultimately why complain about people copying something your like.
Particularly if they won't release on PC
On a true 1-10 scale I'd give it a light 7. On the IGN scale maybe an 8.5.

Maybe you like how it looks, you hear good things from many people, or maybe even it’s just a popular game that other people play that you want to too. Then there are games out there that you buy just because it reminds you of something else. That was part of why I decided to pick this up on a whim. I looked at it and gave me the impression it was inspired by games like Dragon’s Crown and Muramasa. 
So, the game begins with our main character, Vivian, in possession of a mysterious book belonging to her father. We're told that she is trying to use this book to locate him and discover what he's been up to after mysteriously abandoning his family one day. After being interrupted and given a strange message from a mysterious owl creature about obsession leading to madness and tragedy, Vivian and her ship are attacked, leaving her stranded on an unknown land. From there, it is up to her to uncover the mystery all the while dealing with anything and everything getting in her way (intentional or otherwise).
The basic framing of the story and its overall plot are simple to understand when broken down, but I found myself surprised since in the game the story felt very disjointed and confusing. A major reason for this was how there were other mini stories that felt like they were getting in the way of the overall story. Even in the first area after the game establishes what Vivian’s goal is it still decides to spend the first segment asking you to escort some lady to escape her village. The only thing of importance you learn is that she has a brother (who IS a big part of the story) and that is pretty much it. There is a major sub-plot about a magic academy that your companion comes form that hunt down Vivian and others like her, yet it has zero bearing on the story. There is a witch in a forest that you complete a few tasks for all to conclude in an event that has no bearing on anything at all. I usually do not mind smaller sub-plots that are separate from the larger narrative, but I am not a fan of how it’s handled here. Probably because of my other major issue with the story. So much is told to you as a matter of fact. “Oh yeah! I JUST conveniently remember this plot crucial item that someone conveniently has now which explains how they know so much!” Stuff like that is all over the game in Vivian’s monologues and flashbacks. 

Next up would be about presentation. Now this is an odd one to discuss since my feelings on it are mixed. In terms of graphics and aesthetics I think the game is quite good. The game has a pleasing art style to it, reminiscent of titles like Dragon Crown or Muramasa: The Demon Blade. The backgrounds remind me a lot of waterbrush paintings with soft colors in a lot of areas. There are a few issues with textures in backgrounds going back in a few spots but aside from that they look great, especially considering how much of a budget game this. I do enjoy the look of the game a lot but unfortunately, I can’t say the same for the some of the sound design. Don’t get me wrong, most of the music is good/great. The boss theme I enjoy, some of the areas have kickass pieces and others do a good job of setting the ambiance. The graveyard is a good example of the latter and the piece that plays in the latter half of Hell is a good example of the former. Alas, someone doesn’t know how to mix sounds well or just outright forgot to add them in places (it’s particularly notable in several boss fights where you expect your or the boss’ attacks to have punch but you hear nothing at all) 

          I made a comparison to Muramasa in that its art style reminds me of that game, but I can also say that it reminds me of it in gameplay too. It’s a 2-D hack and slash where you go from screen to screen fighting enemies, breaking objects to get money and treasure, as well do some basic platforming and VERY basic “puzzle-solving”. Your combat has you using a sword unleashing some basic multi-hit combos with light and heavy attacks, aerial attacks and combos, some movement abilities like your usual dodge and double jump, and special techniques that can do devastating damage at the cost of your MP. There is also your typical skill tree which allows you to spend Mana, the game’s secondary currency, to get upgrades. A lot of them are stat upgrades. You know the usual HP up, Mana up, STR up, etc. There are some that add other bonuses as well as some that unlock abilities that I just mentioned a moment ago. My only real problem is that you get a couple of them like the double jump from the skill tree which are mandatory to progress in the game but are so cheap it just left me wondering why even bother and not just give it to you for beating a boss or something. The power you have to hack and slash at everything allows most enemies to be taken down without too much trouble though there are those annoying ones that can be a pain to take out. Bosses do fare better. Most of them (at least on normal) are beatable on your first try, though there are a few difficulty spikes with some of them. Their quality is also a mixed bag. Some of them I like, and I think are good. Others are either damage sponges (Mr. Mushroom and Groundshaker) or just hit like trucks. One of the optional superbosses (which is a reskin of an existing boss to boot) is so strong that it can kill you in only 3-4 hits even if you have the best gear in the game. 

In terms the of extras and unlockables there are a few things to help the replayability factor. There are the usual achievements (most of which are completely doable and easy to get in 1 or 2 playthroughs) several difficulty options to make it a bit easier or harder, optional challenges called “rifts”, NG+, and a few hidden “endings”. It’s nothing outstanding but it’s all serviceable enough.

Overall, I can say that I recommend this game. While it is rough in some places with regards to its design like its sound design. narrative, and some graphics I think its other qualities are good enough to compensate for it. It's also important to note how cheap this game is, which helps put into perspective why it might be so rough in places. I don’t think it’s going to blow you away but I think it’s worth your time to check it out, especially if you enjoy a nice hack and slash (or just a game where you can play as a big breasted, semi-barely clothed lady. Hey. I ain’t judging you if that’s why you picked it up)

Is it a must play game? No. Is it worth buying for a buck and a half? Maybe. The best thing about the game is the environmental art is pretty, but then thats it. The animations....the characters....everything else...even the text boxes and text....are very bare bones lackluster placeholder looking systems. Combat as well is nothing special and kinda below average when all is said and done. Expect alot of oldschool ""magical walls go up and prevent u from going back or forward till u kill the enemies onscreeen"" combat.....which pretty much anounts to herding them to the magical walls and then attacking them all at once cause theres so little space to move around  to make fighting worth it. That's pretty lame.

Basically you probably bought it cause of the big boobed yellow haired character on the cover...unfortunately she's just that, nothing more to her than that. Character and plot and everything are bare bones generic. It's really quite disappointing. Now is it worth the sale price....? Again its so cheap that....I can't really say either way. Definitely a skippable experience though. It's weird how vivian appears in battle chef brigade and mina in this game but the combat in battle chef brigade is sooooooo much better even tho its a puzzzle game lol....yet this game is all combat and its nowheree near as nice as the combat in brigade is. I'd just spend the money on battle chef brigade or a more expensive rpg 2d button masher experience. The game really would have benefited from more polish, a better text font/textbox system, and dare I say actual voice acting...instead we have these weird japanese voice sounds that totally subtract from the experience and have nothing to do with the dialogue style or the character looks.",1575325741,1575325850

It's cheap and if you squint a little bit you can almost pretend you're playing a Vanillaware game.  Overall the story is sort of interesting but it boils down to you getting sent on fetch quests while a semi-intriguing plot gets doled out at a snail's pace in between those drudgeriffic tasks.

By the end of the game, I just didn't care anymore.  The game is intent on giving you annoying combos of enemies, economies that just don't function right, and time-wasting obstacles and traps that pose no actual danger other than to your sanity.  

Many of the enemies at the end are offscreen and spit out attacks that are too fast to dodge, knock you around, and eventually whittle your health down.  The obstacles and traps often inflict status effects and are sometimes unavoidable or undetectable at first glance.  This seems to suggest that the game wants you to play at a more measured pace but the platforming is imprecise and movement controls in general are not well-suited for that.

Gold is utterly useless in this game.  You get everything you need from drops and every single item in the game is so absurdly overpriced you're an absolute idiot if you actually buy any of it.  The only thing to buy are recipes, but even those are sort of pointless because they all generally have similar buffs, and the buffs never go away unless you eat a new meal.  If you like the set of buffs you have, eat one meal for the entire game and you're good.

The difficulty spikes in this game are ridiculous as well.  About a quarter through the game there is a boss that hits like an effing truck and then between him and the final boss, nothing even comes close to hitting that hard.  Speaking of the final boss, unless I want to grind annoying enemies for mana to get a reduction in the cost for skills and more ""rage points"" (and I don't want to do that), it's pretty much impossible to beat.

While taking inspiration from Vanillaware games, it stands on it's own, tells a fairly engaging story and won me over with art direction and solid, action packed gameplay.

The Vagrant is action rpg platformer with strong metroidvania roots. It tells a story of Vivian Vermillion, young Runewarden chased by destiny. After being washed away from ship's deck during a storm, Vivian lands on a beach near village of Brocley, which is a  first step toward her grand adventure.

Mechanics (are for cars): What surprised me is the amount of customization the game offers. While you can't change the outfit of your character, you can equip accessories, the weapons have their own unique look and characteristics, you can upgrade them with runes ranged from lvl 1 to 5, you can cook food from recipes giving your character boosts to stats, change the attack skills assigned to 4 button combinations and lastly learn abilities which improve effects of skills, increase defense, attack, crit rate and dozen other effects. Gameplay is fast, instead of blocking, you have a dodge button so precise timing is needed to stay alive. Depending on difficulty setting it reaching the end can take from 7 to 12 hours.

Word about art - it's colorful, crispy at first then direction gradually shifts toward gloomy and dark, backgrounds and characters are memorable and mostly unique. Music is pretty good, fits the situations on the screen. Vivian's animations are smooth and game in motion looks very much like Vanillaware game, although budget cuts can be seen. With proper funding, these guys could deliver the quality at least as good as japanese studio mentioned above.

It just ate my (I believe) ~1800+ word review of this game. I'm not going to write the whole dang thing again. Long story short, awesome visuals, good sound, the map is really weird (sometimes up takes you up, sometimes up takes you down), platforming was a weird choice to put in this game and doesn't feel that great to me, and the game's difficulty between non-bosses and bosses is the biggest difference I've ever seen in a game. The common enemies have no hope of defeating you. The bosses, on the other hand, have multiple spongey health bars, attack very quickly, hit extremely hard, and require repetitive, boring tactics to beat. 

The first two weren't too bad, but the third shoots more projectiles than my dodge can avoid, it spawns ground enemies to attack you on the ground, it spawns aerial enemies to attack you if you jump, it shoots out a death ray thing for several seconds that takes up the entire length of the ground on the battlefield, thus requiring that you jump up into the enemies flying around in the air. If you are the kind of gamer who has crappy real-life Dexterity (you need fast hands), you're probably screwed here. Normally, I grind my way to success by buffing my stats far beyond what's needed to overcome bosses in other games, or I find some weasel way to take the boss out within the rules of the game...either way it needs to take a reasonable amount of time to do, at most. Unfortunately, The Vagrant gates your progress by requiring that you get unique items located in areas you are forbidden from visiting until after the boss in question.

The only option at that point is to grind for ridiculous sums of money to purchase a veritable mountain of healing potions to just stand and fight the boss without bothering to dodge, hitting the attack and heal button over and over until victory. Boredom from that in and of itself aside, quite frankly, I don't want to spend my time grinding gold when I could be playing a game I enjoy or trying another game I've yet to play. I already did some grinding of my stats a bit to try to overcome it, but the best I could do was taking out one of its four health bars before dying. A quick check of YouTube indicates there are quite a lot of bosses in this game, so even if I did manage to cheese my way through this one with health potions, a lack of real-life dexterity, grinding stats, and a mountain of health potions would eventually still fail me before the end of this game.

It's fairly well made and has some good qualities, but the amount of grinding necessary to offset being born without the twitch reflexes some gamers possess is far more than I'm willing to deal with to keep playing, despite the fact that I was beginning to get sucked into the story and the lore.",1572762879,1572762936

The trailer made the combat seem a lot more fun and fluid, the controls are sluggish, I experienced numerous audio and graphical glitches like the music cutting out after less than 2 seconds and the screen remaining black long after area transitions, overall I was kinda let down.

Now that's not to say it's all bad, the skill trees are at least somewhat interesting and give you a reason to want to level up more, the equipment and items actually had some purpose, and honestly despite the weird combat, who doesn't love watching piles of coins and gems burst out of an enemy you just killed?

I'm honestly a fan of the design of the main character.  She may be a bit over-endowed, but those ABS.

In so many other games the females are supposed to wield giant weapons and kick all the ass, yet still look like supermodels.  I'm looking at you, Gears.

It would be nice if there were other outfits, or that armor was represented on-screen.  Probably budget restrictions, but the bikini doesn't QUITE seem to fit her character.  Or her chest.

The artist definitely has a preference for his women.  However ridiculous the protagonist's bodyfat ratio may be, she's still the smallest chest in the land.  I mean holy huge tracts of land, it's... noticeable.

1. You don't ""level up"" by killing monsters.  You ""level up"" by collecting mana, then spending mana to unlock skills (passive and active) in the ABILITY menu.
2. There is a double jump skill and it is available on the ABILITY menu. UNLOCK THIS SKILL EARLY to avoid being stuck on some areas in the game.

[Graphics]
1. Great art work for 2D side-scrolling game.

[Gameplay]
1. As expected with any other 2D side-scrolling game. Responsive controls, using different skills to navigate to higher area, and knockbacks that can send you plummeting to the bottom.
2. Drop items remain intact when moving between locations.  You can go back to collect those items if you accidentally moved to a different area in the map.

But stick with me here! While she is a lot of fun to watch running around, and nearly every single cutscene has an over-emphasis on if not the main characters than at least SOMEONES boobs, the game is ACTUALLY pretty darn good.

The story is nothing new or ground breaking but is perfectly servicable.  I never rolled my eyes or thought something was too corney.  It is what it is: an anime story that sometimes drifts too much into telling more than showing territory but not enough to take me out of the game (likely cause I never totally invested in the first place.)

That non-too-glowing review of the story aside, let me get into the good points of this game.

Combat: For a simple hack-and-slash, the combat was pleasently surprising.  You're given a number of combos you can pull out, along with a dodge and some special attacks.  The combat never gets too deep but it wasn't superficially easy either.  I think for the length of this game, the combat was precisely deep enough.  I honestly enjoyed it the whole way through.

Monster/Boss Design: This is where the game really shines.  The paint-like design of everything is absolutely stunning and I really enjoyed all the monsters, backgrounds, and especially the bosses.  They were all very unique and, to be honest, damn creepy!  It was amazing to see how beautiful everything could look in a non AAA game.

Music:  Maybe my favorite part.  Music starts out slow, or totally silent in some areas.  Then you work into a dungeon and the music starts up a bit.  Mostly something not particularly engaging; you're still outside.  Not in the thick of things yet.  But then you finally broach a dungeon proper and the music kicks up and starts to kick ass!  This is honestly one of my favorite soundtracks in a while.  This is such a subjective thing though, so I suggest going out and listening to something like ""Esgonian Tower"" to see if it's up your alley.

Summary: This game is good.  If there was a sequel, I would buy it.  It's clear, as you play, this is an independent studio sort of game.  It lacks polish in areas.  But it's one of the few games I can say I ENJOYED the whole way through.  It does not overstay it's welcome, nor does it try to be anything it's not.  It's a girl with big boobies fighting stuff, and I unabashedly loved every moment of it.",1569146885,1569146885

Like with any game though, there are some flaws found within as well, albeit very few, very minor ones: trying to attack dense packs of monsters will slow your attack animation down considerably, which can be frustrating at times, and some of the translations to English are a little off the mark, making it evident at times that the game was translated from another language. 

The biggest problem I have with the game though, and this is 100% just a personal gripe than a complaint, is that the world isn't as fleshed out as I wish it was. That's not to say the world you're running around in is devoid of any personality, it's just that with everything that's laid out in and between the various locales you travel to, it feels like there's a lot of lore and stories the world has to offer that it just does not for one reason or another.

[b] tl;dr [/b]

Overall, I will recommend ""The Vagrant"", but I do have some issues with it.
The game can be categorized as a nod to Vanillaware, the Japanese game company that brought us [i] Odin's Sphere [/i] and [i] Dragon's Crown [/i] , and is heavily influenced/borrowing from it. Unfortunately, it falls short of being as good of a game as the mentioned games are.

[list]
[*] Graphics are good, and familiar.
[*] The combat is smooth, but lacking depth.
[*] The platforming idea is nice, but the controls feel a bit wonky for that - in my opinion.
[*] Story is alright and keeps my attention somewhat, but not blowing my socks off.
[/list]

After playing for 9 hours on the hardest difficulty (which feels like normal difficulty), I had to leave it and might not come back to it for the foreseeable future, if ever again.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[b] My experience with [i] ""The Vagrant"" [/i] [/b]
I was excited to see a game resembling [i] Odin's Sphere [/i] and bought the game shortly after discovering it.
I've been playing it for around 9 hours on Lunatic difficulty (aka normal difficulty in other games, for comparison) and I'm nearing the end, but due to some things that have been nagging me, I've decided to shelf it and come back to later or uninstall it back into the void that is ""uninstalled games"" in my Steam Library.

The graphics was what really sold me on the game, and I was happy to play it until I went up against one of the bosses of the game; Santiago, who has been one of the most tedious and frustrating boss fights I remember playing.
This experience really woke me up to what the game actually was; a copycat of a great game.
The developers of ""The Vagrant"" are without a doubt doing something of their own with this game, but it is too similar to [i] Odin's Sphere [/i] so I can't help but compare and be disappointed.

The combat is smooth, and you have a bit of variety when it comes to skills - of which you can pick four from the pool of skills that are available - but that is about it for customization. The rest is just alternating between [i] Light [/i] and [i] Heavy [/i] attacks with your different swords - and when I say different swords, I mean different damage sticks with the occasional element damage on it.
I find this to another part of the somewhat tedious and repetitious gameplay that this game offers.
They try to shake the gameplay up a bit with some good old platforming, but due to what I find to be somewhat wonky controls, this feels slow and stiff to work with.

The story was good enough to keep me somewhat invested, but nearing the end I just wanted to complete the game and get it over with. Without going into detail: I found the story to be predictable and causing unreasonable drama between the characters. Despite me saying this, I do understand the characters different motives and how they perceive the world around them - albeit a bit ignorant and stubborn at times - but this might just be a part of their character.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[b] In conclusion [/b]
I will recommend the game to other players on the platform, but I can't say that I'm fully behind this game for being a bad copycat of a game I adore - although this is what brought the game to my attention.
The gameplay is mediocre to good but gets boring after performing the same four combos for hours on end.
The story is … there, and justifies where you're going next.

All in all, the game is good but tedious.",1566247348,1566247493

Art style is like Dragon's Crown, if I were to compare and very appealing.

Just some small complaints I have, besides the menus not being so clear for beginners, in some boss fight, my screen froze, but then I just reload the last saved file and sometimes the enemy's AI glitches, making them freezing in the stun animation when near some platform edges and inexplicably a boss froze in place after using a skill, making it easy to defeat.

Second major flaw is that the character's in-game sprite feels off-model compared to the portrait and her personality doesn't really fit the outfit she's given (In this case, a chainmail bikini).  The fact that you can purchase a gag item that's a literal bikini leads me to think that the developer intended for that to be the special sprite when using that armor, but cut the original sprite for whatever reason.  Last major criticism has to come down to the fact this game has no method of blocking an attack, only a dodge you have to unlock later on.  Dodging is fine in all, but the lack of a block feature means your character's going to be spamming potions like no tomorrow, and that makes the fights much more boring than they otherwise would be were there a block feature and less emphasis on tanking via potions.",1563104286,1563104286

Personally, I didn't like it. It has the style and appearance of a title from Vanillaware, but it feels more like a half-hearted imitation than anything sincere. The graphics are beautiful, if a little skewed in their proportions, and the story is certainly interesting due to its female lead and unconventional starting point that seemingly goes out of its way to subvert expectations.

The gameplay's simplicity causes both frustration and boredom, and there's a lack of clear communication about some mechanics that make the whole thing a grind. In fact, there's a general lack of speed and precision in this game, which causes a disconnect. When I want my heroine to run, I don't want to have to do a double-tap on the controller and hope the character responds, only to be pushed right back to a glacial walk whenever I hit something.

Coupled with a lackluster soundtrack that doesn't stick in the mind, sound design that feels a little too much like they borrowed from a ""best of sound effects"" compilation, and writing that comes off as awkwardly translated or even downright poor, the problems mount up to make The Vagrant little more than a passing distraction.

[h1] I am not proud of this - The game [/h1]

Steam makes it possible to play so many games that sometimes one does not know what he should or can enjoy. Nowadays I too often look at the price tag to see if something can be worthy of my time.
Often not realising:
A cheap game can be the incarnation of dumb fun.
And if you want to know what ""The Vagrant"" is, the answer is quite simple:
It is a dumpster fire I could not stop playing and I even made a 100% run.
Let´s dive into it.

[h1] Story [/h1]
The edgy heroine who has been betrayed but tries to save the world uncovering the reason for her hard past.
That´s it. 
Look, I know some people expected more, but sometimes it is okay if it is that simple.
Yet still the story is a complete time waste.
Just smash the A button, do yourself the favour, just love yourself once.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
Imagine a generic 2D-Metroidvania with Mana instead of ammunition. The combat itself is button mashing and when the enemy attacks you switch to dodge spamming. There is no punishment, but the game isn´t is easy as it was built around these mechanics. You are going to die a lot later on. Despite being this simple, the combat is quite enjoyable and the second best part about this game.
The platforming is the other aspect and I am happy that the developer had enough brain to not make it the focus. It is tedious and slow, but there is so few platforming that I managed to survive it.

[h1] Visuals [/h1]
Does somebody remember Vanillaware?
Well if you know Vanillaware, I can only describe it as:
The developer was heavily influenced by Vanillaware´s work and we got very well endowed woman in a neat yet generic looking medieval anime world.
It is not breathtaking, but nice enough to be different and I shall compliment it for it´s efforts.
If you have ever played Dragon´s Crown you know what you are in for, because this is the 2 dollar knockoff. The same goes for the gameplay, but I didn´t want to repeat this point through the whole review. But it would be damn accurate.

[h1] Music [/h1]
The best part about this whole game. While the music is generic and not very inspired, it just works so well within the context of the game. When you run through a laboratory and listen to hard-bass, then you reached the point I was sold. Which is pretty late into the game, but still enough.


Conclusion:
Buying this game can only damage your reputation, but not your wallet. 
My review sounds kinda harsh, because I give this game so much flak for being generic and uninspired, but the price makes the deal in this case.
You get a product which is a little above average, but you pay way less than normally. And because it doesn´t take long to complete this game, it is not bad to take the ride and pick it up.
You will not get a completely new experience, but it will also not be a bad one.

The artwork in this game is fantastic. A lot of cool areas to explore, and it changes from ice caverns to forest to a castle. There's plenty to see here. Where it lacks is the character customization options. Changing the armor does not change the armor of the protagonist. But changing a weapon does reflect on the character model. Regardless of this nitpick, it has a great graphics.

The soundtrack was good. Nothing that will entice you to listen to it outside of the game, but it gets the job done well.

Gameplay was pretty good. You could perform a handful of combos, and a dozen or so of ability spells to dispatch your enemies. There are some tricks to the level design that will require you to pay attention. There are very little puzzles, but lots of different enemies to fight. It starts off slow, but picks it up as you progress further very quickly. 

The story was simple, but good. It's told in pictures, and in-game dialogue. It will keep you interested enough to keep going. It's not basic, but it's not superb either. It's good enough that it's better than other straight forward games. With that out of the way, The Vagrant is a very good game that seems to have done bad for various reasons that won't be discussed here. One reason could be that the character models all have great aesthetics that may make some people uncomfortable. So there is no one reason why it did not do well, but I recommend this game to anyone looking for a good 2D action platformer with a good story, and some great gameplay.

I must say that it's pretty good for the price asked, even though it feels like an extremely simplified version of Odin Sphere mixed with some of Dragon's Crown random loot elements. It's still fun, and not too short if you try to max out your abilities and reach the real ending, but the thing that bothers me a little is the fact that some design choices go way beyond being ""inspired"" from Vanillaware and look almost copied. The skill shortcut system, the cooking, and even the design of a couple of bosses are nearly identical to what I've seen in Odin Sphere and I couldn't say whether these choices should be seen as simple homages or not. I guess I'll just give the devs the benefit of doubt since the game isn't a total rip-off.

These considerations aside, it's definitely worth a shot if you like the genre. The story is nothing special but isn't terrible either.

Attacks feel good and chaining combos together is adicting.

I do wish the game was better at telling you what items you have equiped because most of the potions look the same so I would acidently use up my good potions.

While at the core the game mechanics are rather straightforward (2 attacks, dodge, jump, dash, special) and matched by a simplistic level design it works very well as a whole. The controls are decent, the combat hits a sweet spot between button-mashing and thinking (it's rather casual without being mindless) and the artwork of both characters and backgrounds is quite nice. The overall gameplay reminded me of old arcade 2D-action games both in level design and combat.

While the game is not too long there is quite a bit of content to explore; lots of weapons, armor, skills to collect, multiple endings, little optional challenges and a ng+ mode. I would have probably enjoyed a longer game but on the upside it never felt like a grind and didn't overstay its welcome. 

I couldn't find any major bugs or other issues. The only glitch I encountered was an animation frame stuck on the player character which was reset by saving and loading.

the game itself is short if u just try to muscle threw it, but if you want to unlock all the abilities,skills and so forth your gonna have to wonder around and look for them. it has good rpg factors to the game, and cool weapon selection. the accessories you wear are cool and can be quite helpful.there is also armor which helps a lot, i just wished it changed the look of your character when you equipped it. this is a minor over sight though considering how good the game is. there are also potions in the game that increase certain attributes to your character in which you will need playing in harder diff, especially when you try and find the rifts in the game. these can be very challenging and frustrating to play as these bosses and npcs can hit hard.

has a really good story to, with mulitple endings to it in a way that is not the norm as you would expect. they did a really good job with this game, and again with the price of 4 dollars you cant loose.

combat is fun and becomes even more crucial as you unlock them in the skill trees as get deeper into the game. now unlocking the skill tree is not easy bc you have to find certain objects to progress farther in some the trees, and some you just need to even purchase the skills. i like this bc it sets you out to play the whole game not just portions of the game, and feel more involved in the game play. the combat can be clunky in crowds of enemies, but a small over sight, and you do have a dodge/roll button in the game that if utilized right can make you feel like a bad ass lol.

The double tap of analog stick or digital pad doesn't always get acknowledged by the game. It is random, so I am continually changing between both input formats on the fly when one starts to become clunky.
[h1]I think an adjustable 'gamepad saturation level' setting might solve this.[/h1]
Or, maybe setting things like dash to a button instead of 'double tapping' may also fix it if a possibility.

Positive;
Artwork design throughout is quite nice.
There is a lot to collect and the expected RPG elements are here.

Average;
Walking around the world and comparing the in-game art to the 'box type' in-game map felt jarring.
I felt a little bored for some reason. Maybe the story could have been a bit more polished.
The game seems linear, you also go back and forwards between the same sectors sometimes. Although they try to change them in some way, day/night, different type of enemy, etc. But you are still travelling through same area.
Also with the world layout, it is highly possible for someone not checking the map to go around in circles. lol.
What didn't help was that I noticed some items re-appearing as I moved between some sectors. I was able to 'recollect previously collected resources', theoretically could this mean a loophole for 'unlimited' resources?

Negative;
Combat is a major component of a game like this and although overall there is a lot of depth here, more than you normally see. The clunky feel of the controls as mentioned above just kills it.

Notable experience;
When I defeated the first major boss on my first play attempt after working through his 5? health bars, the game covered the screen to progress the story. When this happens the player is locked out of control to read the story, although this is expected as most games work like this.. Problem was that there were still three of the boss bombs on screen which detonated in the background while this was going on. Either the detonations killed my character or maybe from the after fire damage of the incendiary effect of the bombs. So, after reading how I defeated that boss etc, I was shockingly greeted by a 'game over' screen. I used all my potions to defeat the boss and was quite chuffed that I was able to survive through his 'waves', but that forced cheap death by the game has left a sour taste.",1557798656,1557798656

It doesn't quite reach the level of excellence of Vanillaware; however, it is a very good game, especially knowing the small team that created the Vagrant.

If you like 2D side scrolling action games such as Golden Axe,  Captain Commando, Odin Sphere, Muramasa the Demon Blade, Dust and Elysian Tail, Metroid, or old school Castlevania, then you will really enjoy the Vagrant.  

Pros:
+ Fast paced combat.
+ I liked the storyline.
+ Beautiful 2D artwork.
+ Entertaining boss fights, especially at higher difficulty.
+ Small RPG element.
+ Very good value ratio when comparing the Quality - Length - and Price Point.  I am thinking of buying a few extra copies to friends to support the developers' work.

Moving Vivian around levels and executing attacks and generally participating in the combat is great fun.  Basic enemies have reasonably varied designs and attacks and ways to deal with them for a <$10 game, a few bosses are kind of lame, but others are awesome fights.

The story in a broad sense is good.  I cared about the characters and what happened to them (up to a point, anyway) because of the setting, given backstories, and events in the game.  I felt Viv was fighting against odds for a happy ending, and there was constantly a real feeling that it might not happen.  All that kept me wanting to keep playing, beat things, win fights, and find that light at the end of the tunnel.  

The specifics get shaky, particularly where dialogue is concerned.  It's very obvious the dialogue was translated from another language, between how on-the-nose it could be, and the occasional grammatical error.  Not, by any stretch, the end of the world, but there was a slight lack of polish in that regard.  The only major gripe I have is that the series of steps you need to run through to get the ""Good Ending"" is something you'd absolutely need a guide to figure out.  I was having fun and going through every room and cleaning house and scouring the map and stuff, and still only accidentally did half of the long series of things that is required to get a good ending.  I didn't actually reference any guide until after I got a ""Bittersweet"" ending because a guide would only spoil things.  After that, I didn't care enough for another playthrough just to do 5 more steps to get a better ending when I can see the ending on YouTube, and damn near everything else is exactly the same.

Still, I definitely got my money's worth, and even my time's worth in playing this game.",1557478878,1557478878

And unlike Muramasa, it has a very nice difficulty curve where monsters are neither too easy, nor too hard.

Most of the enemies are too slow, their AI too simple. All you have to do is roll behind them and mash the attack button, or do a heavy combo to break their guard and then mash the attack button. This applies to most of the bosses as well. Getting injured? No problem. The game offers several different ways of healing yourself.

Your character is permanently in a bikini... why? Because the devs like showing breasts, that is the only logical explanation for a ""sellsword"" to be dressed like that. Also EVERY other female character in the game has absolutely huge breasts too, normally on display. Oh, your character can buy/find armor, it just doesn't change the character model.

Items cost a ton of money. The first sword upgrade costs 8000g. You find one in a chest rather quickly, but still, that just sets the stage for how insane the item pricing is. 

Combat feels clunky and repetitive. You can get a couple combos, but for the most part just spamming your light attack kills everything. You get locked into rooms until you kill all the enemies that show up, so if you don't feel like killing the 1000th zombie you've encountered too bad, get chopping. Dodging feels odd, mostly because there is a very obvious spot mid dodge where your character just seems to hold still for a split second. Speaking of dodging, you can dodge out of any of your attacks... after you purchase it on the skill tree, until then your character is locked into her attacks. It feels less clunky when you get that upgrade, but still feels like they just slapped together a basic combat system and just called it good without bothering to tweak it. 

Art is wonderful (minus the breast thing I mentioned earlier), music is lack luster, and dialogue is incredibly sub-par. It is obvious all their resources went into the art and they didn't bother to bring in a decent story writer or voice actors. Cut scenes are not skippable, which is honestly just downright offensive in 2019. Let's put a cut scene before a really hard, cheesey boss fight, that way when the player dies they can watch it over and over and over!

Story in a nut shell. You are on a ship, Random T Owl shows up, says something cryptic and disappears, ship crashes. You wake up on an island, save a woman, and then you find out you are effectively the ""chosen one"".  Boom, done!

Honestly, I'd like to recommend this. I was looking forward to playing it. But even for the $2 I paid for it, it feels like I paid too much. At least too much to make up for the boring combat, bad story/dialogue, and annoying mechanics.",1551666149,1551666149

The combat, for a side-scroller, is also rather decent, and can be pretty in depth at times - again, for a side-scroller.

Nevertheless, after just a few minutes of play, it became obvious that the game was going to suffer from several glaring issues.  The story itself is pretty generic, a missing family leads to a mystical ‘chosen one’ style quest, and starts off with deus-ex machina style ‘mystery’ characters, etc..  Not a crippling issue, but the story opens on a bit of an ‘eye roller,’ involving a wrecked ship, and from there you rescue someone from a wild boar on a mystery island, and are rewarded with a room and a treasure chest…out of freaking nowhere, and it’s pretty downhill from there.

However, the biggest, worst, most unforgiveable part of this game is absolutely cringe inducing dialogue.  The dialogue is stilted, unimaginative, unnatural, and simply takes you out of any immersion that the beautiful visuals imbue into the game.  The mismatch between the horrid dialogue and the painstakingly hand-drawn scenes is absolutely jarring, as if the writers here had never opened a novel in their entire lives to see what written dialogue should read like.  

I know this sounds like a strange criticism, but again, the absolute lack of depth in this game’s dialogue is so jarring that it actually breaks the immersion of the game.

(Very good for its price)

============

Review:

The Vagrant is basically an Action-Platformer with light RPG elements.

You slash your way across different lands, collecting gold, mana (XP in this game) and items. You upgrade your gear and use mana to unlock and level up skills.

Generally when I see a Platformer game, I think its designed for the younger audience.

But this game is definitely not designed for kids - there are some quite freaky looking monsters that can cause nightmares for sensitive people. It also has ample bosoms all game long, which might offend some people. So it requires a certain kind of tolerance.

The Art of the game is excellent - it has beautiful hand-painted 2D art, and the animations are smooth. The game is truly pleasant to look at, especially when you consider how cheap it is.

Graphics aside, the game also has very good music. The genres shift quite radically, but all of the songs fit in the game well. Sound effects also do their job just fine.

The story is nothing special, but it serves its purpose. You'll be focusing on leveling up and getting gear anyway.

Basically the only bad thing I can think of is that the game becomes repetitive after a while. Especially if you're trying to get achievements. It's not really that much of a problem though, as the game is quite short.

If you just play the game, it will last for about 10 hours. But it will last considerably longer if you go for the true ending and chase achievements.

============

But I do have to mention that this game is well worth the price. I got it on sale for 1-2 euros, but I think its worth its full price! I was really positively surprised how good the game was, when I just randomly purchased a cheap game.

If you like 2D Platformer-type games, and don't mind the adult themes, then I highly recommend this game! 
Like I said before, it's a very good game for its price. Just don't expect an AAA-title and you're good to go.

Summary:

The Good 👍

+ Very good music

Genre: 2D Action RPG

The Good:
+ Great art style, feature 6 areas, each area with its own unique look 

+ Surprisingly good story, the developers put some real effort here

+ Multiple skills that can be upgraded making you feel very powerful later in the game. 

+ Lots of different weapons, armor and accessories that can be upgraded and enhanced with runes giving you plenty of variety in character builds.

+ Solid combat featuring light and heavy attacks. You can unlock combos in the skill tree in addition to finding active skills in treasure chests located around the world giving you good incentive to explore. 

+ Over 70 enemies each with its own attack patterns
+ Fun boss battles 

The Average:
+/- This game has a ridiculous breast to body ratio. 

The Bad:
- This game can feel repetitive as the entire game is going into an area, kill enemies, and move onto the next area until you reach the boss battle. Some of the later areas have some platforming involved but it doesn’t really change the feeling of a repetitive gameplay loop.

Conclusion:
I paid 1$ when this was on sale, and it is probably the best 1$ game that I have played. I particularly enjoyed the game and the combat. I mean, there are worse ways you can spend a couple of bucks so why not try a fun action rpg that will last you a couple of hours.

-Visually beautiful. I love the overall art style, especially the backgrounds. It takes a page from Nintendo and proves you don't need high-end graphical fidelity to have a gorgeous game.
-Difficulty settings are so accurate to the actual FEEL of the game. I'm honestly blown away by this. Usually, when I see games with difficulty settings, I think ""Okay, but how hard is your Hard? How 'normal' is your Normal?"". Of course, I did that with this game, but for once, it felt right. Usually, games are easier than they claim, or much harder. This game has the goldilocks of difficulty settings, at least as far as ""Normal"" is concerned.
-The protagonist is a badass. Also she kinda looks like Yang from RWBY so... She's waifu status in my eyes.
-The gameplay is satisfying, responsive, and has a lot of options, with unlockable passive buffs and abilities, new special attacks to unlock, a variety of swords to find, potions, food, accessories and armor... AND the gameplay ITSELF has depth. Not just your options. There are a couple different fire traps, THREE unique projectile traps(that I can recall!), spears that will jutt out of the floor to mess you up, and more. Enemies have a variety of different ways of hurting you... I can go on.
-The bosses are all very unique and ALL are fun to fight. SPOILER: One boss, you have to kill his MINIONS to hurt him in the first phase. You don't see that too often in games. Clever idea!

Cons:
-One thing about the art direction I REALLY don't like... The female characters. With the exception of one, ALL of them have giant breasts. And hey, some ladies are busty, but this is ridiculous. The protag takes it a step further by wearing practically nothing. I put plated armor on her and... boobs still hangin' out. Right. Clearly whoever designed the characters is a pervert and doesn't fully respect women. At least Vivian makes up for her embarrassing attire by being cool AF.
-This game CAN run on a 4 year old Toshiba Satellite. So that's cool. The problem? It is HARD AS BALLS to make it run well. I needed to get an external SSD to run the game on(luckily I had already ordered one before I purchased the game!), I had to run GameGain to tweak my PC settings in favor of gaming performance, set Texture Quality in AMD Radeon Settings to ""Performance"", set the Graphics setting in the game to ""Low"", and cut down the resolution. I would have cut the resolution further, but it cut off the names of items I was picking up, so I had to settle for a middle ground. Thankfully, with all that done, it still looks good, and plays well enough, at least for Normal difficulty. But holy halibut batman, that's a lot of tinkering and testing! I spent the first 2 hours of playtime just TRYING TO GET THE GAME TO A PLAYABLE STATE.
-Okay so, a lot of amateurish mistakes are present in this game. A lot of typos, mediocre grammar at best, even some Engrish. ""Percision"". ""Antitode"". REALLY? The UI looks so basic and barebones, too. The Ability menu is SO SLOW to move the cursor... The story also suffers from similar problems. The IDEA of the story is fine, I think it's neat, but the delivery of the story, is bad. The dialogue is mostly out-of-left-field exposition or way-too-convenient Aha! moments. (ex. The protag suddenly remembers she saw one of the other characters several years ago, just to raise the stakes even higher.) TL;DR, there are many bits of lazy design elements strewn throughout the game.
-Finally, Achievements. Most seem fine, pretty much par for the course. I have a problem with the ""die to this boss"" achievements, however. While it is a clever and interesting idea, it was very easy for me to crush a bunch of bosses, accidentally die to one(he was easy, actually, I just goofed up pretty badly xD), and only THEN did I find out these were a thing. Hidden achievements are always a stupid idea in my opinion, and that is the crux of the issue. Still, ""get killed by this guy"" is a bad achievement. Good on you for thinking outside the box, but, please don't make a habit of this. Consider it a lesson learned.

Wow this was a long one, huh? Despite the glaring flaws in this game, I actually enjoy it quite a bit. The gameplay is a lot of fun, and makes up for the many blemishes you will no doubt encounter. It is the first vaguely Metroidvania-esque game I ever played, and enjoyed. If you want to hack-and-slash your way to victory, traverse beautiful environments, and snicker at those amateur hour design choices, The Vagrant is the right game for you. You know, that title sounds kinda lame. The Vagabond would be much more badass if you really think about--

It's a decent hack and slash, with great graphics. As every other review noticed, it feels like a Vanillaware fan game.

Sadly, after a gorgeous first part, the game went kind of down for me. Playing on hard, I found that a lot of the damage came from attacks that came from offscreen enemies I couldn't predict, or from Vivian getting stunlocked by some apparently badly-balanced moves (lighting attacks tend to do that, especially on bosses like Santiago or enemies like the thunder wolf). The game avoids getting unplayable just because it features some exploitable tricks and an abundance of potions.
Perhaps it's hard mode being harder than anticipated, perhaps it's me getting old and bad.

Story also gets annoying, with the villain mostly progressing by ruining your progress in cutscenes.
Environmental design and enemy descriptions help more than the either unispired or poorly-translated dialogue.

It obviously can't compete with big budget titles, but for a low budget title made by an indie developer, its pretty good. Some of the negative reviews complain that the main character is a half naked girl with large breasts. This aspect of the game will, depending on your tastes, either be a selling point or a deterrent for playing the game. If you are in the latter group, you might still want to give it a chance if the other aspects of the game sound appealing, if you can get past that.

It is true that the combat isn't particularly complex, but using rage attacks and other tricks (dive kicks and sweeps) makes it better. Truthfully, if you're playing the game mainly for the gameplay, then you might not be impressed. The gameplay is solid, but unremarkable. How you feel about the game is largely going to depend on how you feel about the overall presentation. The combat, the characters, the art, the music, the sometimes cool and sometimes grotesque monsters you fight. I thought a lot of that was pretty appealing. The music varied between atmospheric fantasy music to quiet and ominous music, and even tense heavy metal music in some areas. It should also be mentioned that there are in fact branching pathways, and multiple endings. There are hidden areas, and older areas may sometimes have surprises later on. Its even possible to finish the game while bypassing numerous parts of the game, either because you missed them or because you couldn't find the key to enter a certain area. Patient players who enjoy exploring will probably find this appealing.

At any rate, this game is a little rough around the edges, but I'd say its worth playing if you're a fan of this style of game,",1546973563,1547761302

The Vagrant is an extremely simple hack n' slash game with (very grindy) RPG elements. There is a story, but it's told very shoddily through poorly paced unskippable cutscenes with dialogues that sound like they were poorly translated from another language. The stages are very simplistic and flat with no obstacles or platforming.

It is NOT a Metroidvania. There is no free exploration that gets progressively unlocked as you gain traversal abilities. In fact, there are no traversal abilities to unlock new paths, and existing paths the game doesn't want to you travel to yet are either blocked off by force fields or simply a text box telling you that you're not supposed to go in that direction yet. It's actually just ridiculous that the game has two different contradictory types of invisible walls that are both not at all justified by ingame reasons for stopping you from exploring.

And just so there's something positive to say, yes the art is nice- an imitation Odin Sphere/Vanillaware style that is pretty decently animated as well.

I need to say up front, I'm a mark for any game that even tries to ape Vanillaware.  The graphics are amazing for something made by such a small studio, and the stylized character designs are charming in my opinion.  So far I'm greatly enjoying The Vagrant, and the cooking mechanic, shallower though it may be compared to that of something like Muramasa or Odin Sphere, helps tickle my fan nerves.

However, the gameplay is not by any means as complex as, say, Dragon's Crown--it's pretty easy to lock down enemies with a few basic combos and never take a serious hit or need to use healing potions until you come to a boss, in which case you'll start needing to chug them one after another if you've yet to get the hang of things.

My main recommendation to any player is to buy the double jump, air dodge, and similar abilities that expand your mobility as soon as possible.  And to the developers at OTK Games, I'd actually rather you made those something the player acquires through story progression, as giving the player the freedom in the Abilities tree can make them miss (as I did at first) that they're actually there.  As platforming becomes more complex, the double jump is vital and it's a real drag to have to go back and grind experience for it, even for a little while.

Oh, and one more minor gripe: In-combat subtitles.  There are some enemies who talk, yell, and taunt during their boss fights, but their dialogue will go over the heads of anyone who doesn't speak Japanese.

Overall though, the game is a real diamond in the rough, especially for a bargain priced beat-em-up.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good, solid action game and longs for the days of King of Dragons or Shadow Over Mystara.",1546562756,1546562756

Maybe average... So for me a 6/10. I say that because I couldn't be bothered to finish the final ""bosses"" nor attempt the secret true ending. Yes, bosses. With a save mechanic that forces you to redo all the final ""bosses"" again. And this is all because of the boss battles.

The game itself has a wonderful combat system. Attacks feel like they hit and you can move around while attacking various enemies. Whether you are dodging, walking, running, attacking, rage special attacking or heavy attacking, the entire system feels smooth and fun. The only exception to this is jumping. There is a delay that causes this smooth flow of combat to halt. If you feel like you aren't hitting hard enough just grab equipment or abilities that make your attack stronger. This simple design works well here. Should definitely mention the art style and use of the Unreal Engine as the game looks really well made. I especially love all the different environments for the levels and their transitions from one season to the next in different areas on the map.

However, in saying that, the story and mission design starts off really bad. I had no idea what was going on or who I was. This felt weird as the progagonist knows and tells you over time in the beginning of the game when it's too late and it feels rather sudden rather than explaining this in the introduction of the game. Whilest I mentioned the combat is great, there are two major issues. That being the dodge mechanic and boss battles. You'll learn by the second boss battle that all you need to do is dodge. You literially cannot be hurt using it whilest you are in the animation. No attack, no trap, no arrow, cannon, fire, etc will touch you. The game becomes an incredible rolling simulator. Especially in boss battles.

Now the main reason I couldn't finish this game. Boss battles. My God... they are boring and some are frustratingly terribly made. There is a difference between ""difficult but yet fair, challenging thus fun"" compared to poorly developed bosses like ""let's spam enemies at the player over and over again"" or ""Let's make this guy have a weakspot that's hard to hit, can be covered up and the player has to jump attack to hit it which does barely any damage."" These game mechanics ruin the game in my opinion. As each boss battle originally starts off with a unique design. But, suddenly all the bosses started to get the same game mechanics and they were just terrible. These boss battles forced me to abuse the game rather than play it the way I wanted to. A good example of this is the Golem Boss. Bashing enemies into the wall and kill them as quickly as possible just so I could finally damage the boss, get poisoned in the process because there's no time, within a small time frame before more enemies spawn and the opportunity to attack is lost. For a very... very... long time. And yes, unlimited enemies...

I still have to recommend this game however as the game is really well made and kept me company for the whole day. If there was a ""Maybe"" button rather than just a Yes or No option to recommending then I would choose the Maybe optiion. I reckon there are a lot of peoplethat will like this game and may forgive the issues I had.",1546343587,1546343587

Do you remember how much time you spent over looking for something without any walkthrough? Have you ever heard of a Korean pearl called ""My Friend Koo""? Well then, here comes ""The Vagrant"", its Chinese cousin!

[b]THE STORY[/b]
Our protagonist's name is Vivian. She must find out what happened to her family. After waking up at Brocley Village, she begins to look for clues which may help her solve the mystery. As a sellsword and Runewarden, Vivian is capable of developing her abilities and skills... that may be useful for someone else's purposes.

[b]THE GAMEPLAY[/b]
Grind-oriented and dynamic. The enemies spawn quickly, so to increase our success in fight we have the ability tree which allows to develop bonus stats and skills, e.g. double jump or dodging. Now imagine: I didn't know that, so I crossed almost 75% of the game with Heaven's Fall attack serving for higher jumps! Speaking of Heaven's Fall, it is one of special powers hidden in certain levels. Those powers require rage points, just like buying any bonus stat or skill from the ability tree requires mana points. Believe me, it's not that complicated. The runes added to our equipment, the food recipes and the crafting patterns are helpful, too. Overall, we can travel between the already visited areas via stone tables when we need something. The game menu is accessible at any moment. The worse case is about saving - you must visit the mentioned stone table or the campfire.

[b]THE GRAPHICS[/b]
Hand-painted, with moving parts in the background of some levels, e.g. demonic plants. What should be added: the further we go, the darker our surroundings become - typical for many platform games. The characters look cute or scary, however, you may say the females wear too skimpy clothes. Personally I don’t think that ruins anything. If you had watched anime like “Slayers” or played games like “Skullgirls”, you should see that oversized breasts aren’t any big issue (pun not intended). There are also visual novel cutscenes. I don't mind, but the font of dialogue lines should be a little bigger.

[b]THE SUMMARY[/b]
If you remember the games where you needed to get almost everything on your own, including even the simpliest skills, “The Vagrant” may be a nice nostalgia run. The soundtrack, composed by Gabe Castro, deepens that nostalgia vibe. Some classical music, some folk, dance and metal. I won't lie - that was one of the main factors which made me put ""The Vagrant"" on the ""recommended"" list. The second factor was the gameplay similar to ""My Friend Koo"" in some parts.

This game is great and an interesting experience if you enjoy side-scrolling beatemups or simple dark fantasy games. While this is an RPG with a tree character building system, these elements feel more tact on for padding out the contents of the game while not fixing some minor issues I find with the combat. 

One issue with the combat is that there is no real opening move that is effective. Dashing and attacking allows a quick slash that sends you past the enemy and walking is too slow to be useful in any instance even for zoning. The only effective way I could find to string a combo was to quickly slash while running then while passing them I attacked in the opposite direction. This lead to another issue, which was the absence of a block button.

 Look, I get that blocking is sometimes broken and leads to turtling, but not being able to block and mashing dodge is just boring. The dodging is effective but I find it more a mindless panic button than an actual move. My attempts to use dodging intelligently just turned into me hitting it for every attack thrown at me. There isn't much variety in the enemy patterns (which is understandable), which is why I don't get why there is no block button. The dodge just makes it harder to keep track of your own movements since it has a ton of I-frames. For example, I just got done fighting the first human form boss in the game and she was easy to defeat since everything she did was telegraphed. The fight didn't need to be more difficult, it just got boring having to interrupt my combat mid-string to hit the dodge button and avoid all damage. If there were a block button, I could probably continue my combo instead of having to dodge, orient myself then sweep back, orient myself and try to make a new combo.

While it seems facile to complain about orienting myself for the new situations mid-combat, these breaks ups happen a lot due to the dodging mechanic. I don’t have the highest Rage regeneration which is probably why the combat has been a lot of dodging, light attack, light attack, light attack, heavy for me. Being able to mix up the special moves more would definitely make the combat feel better for me, which is why I think this issue with the combat is minor.

My general mode of gameplay is to construct flashy and interesting combos in these kinds of games. I don’t like to cancel because it makes the combat look choppy. I like the flare of just the pure full animations coming together. Light attack light attack heavy, light attack light attack, down diagonal heavy, light attack light attack light attack heavy.  This is a good game, and I hope they will make more like it.",1543590989,1543673751

It has a very decent duration for its price (6-12 hours on your first playthrough depending on how many sidecontent you do like boss rush and getting the true ending, plus 4 difficulty modes and new game plus) and its overall a blast to play.

The combat is simple but fun, with weak attacks that make combos when combined with strong attacks and skills. You dont level up but there´s a nice ability tree that grants more or less fullfils that role, you also gain stronger weapons and armor that you can enchant with different runes/effects (like inmunity to poison and such). 
The  boss fights look awesome and some of them are really well designed but the thing that impressed me the most was its level design, considering its a sidescroller focused on combat its amazing how fun it is to explore and how thankful I was for the overlay map feature.

First off though, the good stuff! The music's extremely good, the art style's wonderful, and overall gameplay's not too bad. Nothing all that fancy, controls can be a little sluggish at times but not horrible. A lot of walking around with not much to see other than pretty backgrounds, but it's enjoyable overall. The boss battles are a bit... bland. They seem to enjoy unavoidable attacks and catching you while you're stuck in an attack animation you can't back out of, but potions are plentiful so it's not like it's a huge deal, just a nuisance so far. This may change later on in the game, but overall the game itself is enjoyable enough to play, especially for its exceptionally low price point.

But... that leads into the problems. It's... glitchy, shall we say, at best.

So far I've run into a number of times where the game won't let me talk to anyone unless I exit the area and come back again, despite that it clearly should be possible to talk. The most recent occurrence actually glitched the whole cutscene out and after the cutscene ended, I was left standing next to a copy of myself which hadn't despawned. There was a point when the map wouldn't go away until I removed it with the keyboard because it ignored the controller's inputs, and another time when the controller entirely just stopped being recognized until I unplugged it and plugged it back in - I could still access the menu with it but no movement/attack commands. Really weird stuff.

The writing is also... meh. Four times in the first hour of gameplay I ran into situations where various characters and events were set up for automatic failure where you have no choice in what happens and you just have to put up with the enforced failure. Once is fine, making a point of things early on in the game that you're still a bit weak and need to become better. Four times in a row is getting absurd. I'm really hoping this isn't the only literary trick the writer knew, because so far it feels like it.

The translation's a little off, but it's about 98% accurate. You'll notice some oddities like ""Heavy attack deals more damages."" and other minor errors fairly often, but they're not a big deal, just a little awkward here and there. It's common enough that every few dialogues you'll run into something that's slightly off on the translation, but most of the time it's too minor to really matter.

The loading screens, however... these are really weird and random. I've got a pretty reasonable system and yet sometimes a loading screen for an area can literally have you sitting there for 20-30 seconds straight waiting for stuff to load. Which is kind of absurdly long for something that appears as though it should be a relatively instant loading time. What's more odd, is that these long load times are completely arbitrary it seems. You can be in an area, load it in 1 second, it just fades to black then back in again, no problem! Accidentally go out of the area by walking the wrong direction since it doesn't always put you where you'd think you'd be, and have to load the same area back up again, except the second time, instead of a 1 second load, it takes a full 26 seconds the next time for no apparent reason. What's worse, is that during this loading where the screen is black, enemies can still attack you, but you can't see the enemies, the terrain, nor yourself. You can still move and attack back, but you can't see what you're doing. I can't say I was really impressed with this.

Overall though, I'm still enjoying myself. The gameplay is fun, though rather limited, but this may open up as I play further into the game. There seems to be a fair number of locked off features which are unlocked gradually throughout gameplay so there'll probably be plenty more interesting stuff to come. The dialogue's kind of mediocre, but not outright bad, and the characters do distinctly have different personalities so props to them there. For the low price of the game, it's probably worth picking up, but be forewarned that it's pretty heavily bugridden in a lot of annoying ways. You get what you pay for, and while a cheap game usually means cheap gameplay, in this case it seems to mostly mean cheap coding.

To be honest, I'd recommend the game at the price it is just for the music alone - the game itself is a nice bonus to go with it.",1543102885,1543102885

- Price (2 bucks in early access and 4 in time of writing)
- RPG mechanics / skilltree / abilities
- Lots of different enemies and bosses
- Combat system and boxing
- Soundtrack
- Art style of the cut scenes

Neutral:
- Story

Cons:
- Some achievements

Pros:
I bought the game in early access for 2 bucks but played after it was released. So I noticed no bugs or what so ever.
It took me about 17h to get every achievement. I did two playthroughs. The first one on normal difficulty and the second one on very hard, since it’s an achievement to do so. The first one needed about 14h in which I got every achievement except “very hard mode” and “Rune packed”.
I have to point out that the soundtrack is really awesome. It has lots of different genres and always represents the actual situation very well. I liked the metal tunes the most.
Furthermore the combat system stands out because it is smooth and it has no problems with boxing. Which means hitting after an enemy but doing no damage.
I too liked the art style of the cut scenes. They are well painted and stand out compared to most JRPG games.

Neutral:
I was surprised that there is a story at all and it is not even so thin like a lot of similar games (cough JRPG cough) But of course it is not as deep as Serious Sam ;-)

Cons:
There are two achievements which are very annoying. The first one is “mana collector”. You have to use a glitch to trigger a respawn of a skeleton which gives about 10k gold and 10K mana. When I was at the end of my first playthrough I needed to grind this guy about fifty times.
There are some abilities, weapons and armour which need lots of mana.

- About 200K for completing the start ability and get the last skill
- About 100K for completely enhance the sword of verum
- About 100K for completely enhance the sword of deception
- 200K for bying the bikini which, fully enhanced is the strongest armour

At the end of the first playthrough I had none of this things. After grinding this 600K mana I still didn’t got the achievement. I had to kill him another five to ten times. To get the final 1KK mana.
I found out that using a very strong sword and knocking him down over and over goes faster then actually fighting him combos and stuff. The hungry demon is quit good for this. When you have the sword of deception it goes much faster since it is the strongest sword.

The second annoying achievement is “Rune packed”. You have open certain treasure boxes to get a armour or weapon with four runes attached. The problem is, that once opened a treasure box will not close again after coming back later. That means you have to reload the game over and over until you get one. I was lucky and needed only about 15 minutes to get one. I read from other players how needed more than an hour.

After having a maxed out character the very hard mode is actually very easy. It took me 3h including the “Rune packed” achievement to finish it.

On the Steam store page the devs say, that the game has multiple endings. Yes that is true but it is very badly implemented. You basically have to kill or die in certain places to get these endings. 
The only alternative ending which is different triggered is the true ending “Seed of life”.

Final thoughts:
I really recommend this game for the said reasons. The only downside are some achievements but I guess that is irrelevant for the most players anyway. So buy it!",1541949352,1541949352

Looking at the cover, my first thought was ""That's funny, the protagonist looks like Yang from RWBY. Let's check it out.""
I'm so glad I did.

I expected a very short and simple Beat 'em Up game that would be fun for a couple hours and I'd be done with it. For a 4$ game on sale for 2$, my expectations weren't exactly high. But in the end, I got much more than I thought for my money.

Beat 'em Up in the same vain as Dust: An Elysian Tail and Odin Sphere, The Vagrant is easy on the eyes and beautifully animated. I was happy to see the model of my blade change on the character when I equipped a new one, but I was surprised to see the elemental blade actually change the visuals of my big slashes and some of my special attacks.

Gameplay-wise it starts out pretty simple and straightforward, but you're soon presented with a multi-branch skill tree where you can quickly unlock new moves and abilities. The game does a good job of throwing at you enough unlock currency (mana) and loot so you're not stuck grinding for hours and starving for potions/new gear.

Speaking of gear, you can use your mana to level up your weapons/armors, increasing their power but also opening up enchantment slots where you can plug runes you find so that new sword you really like won't become useless 5 minutes later.

The story is nothing groundbreaking, but it was enjoyable and interesting enough that by the end of the game, I was invested in the protagonist's goal and I wanted to see it through. The NPCs also had plenty of extra lines if you kept talking to them, which is neat.

Difficulty-wise, be warned that the difficulty levels are mislabeled. I played on the Hard level and was slightly disappointed that the challenge was only at a moderate/normal level. So don't be afraid to pick a difficulty higher than usual with this game. Just make sure your dodge timing is on point, otherwise the game will chew you up mercilessly.

There's a large variety of enemies in the game and the bosses are quite different from one another. There's also secrets hidden everywhere, so taking the time to go off the trail is always rewarded with something nice, be it treasures or something more unique.

I could go on and on about this game but the bottom line is, this is an hidden gem. I'll be sure to come back to it for another playthrough (on Lunatic difficulty this time!)

So if you enjoy that style of Beat 'em Up, I can recommend The Vagrant without hesitation.",1539225129,1539225129

Play as Vivian, a poor designed exhibism female protagonist, on her advanture to reveal the truth behind her father's secret. The story is pretty weak for RPG standard, it just got less attractive and even boring after 2 hours, as well as the gameplay, some boss battles are actually pretty chanllenging, but aside of that, the whole game is just feel so repetitive an dull, it just can't give me the passion to explore, to advance, like a good RPG should do. And the game is pretty short, you can finish it in 10 hours, can't say that's a bad thing, bcause thanks to that, I don't have to suffer much longer.
In conclusion, despite all these flaws, at least this game is functional, it works as a low-budget game should, and it even features some quite impressive soundtracks.

Unfortunately, it can't compare in every category. The combat is pretty simple (though quite enjoyable) with light and heavy attack. The heavy attack though is pretty useless, so the game is reduced to spamming light attacks. Most fights come down to dogging the enemies attacks then wailing on them until you win. The crafting side of it I didn't use once is my playthrough on Lunatic difficulty. Eating meals is similar. Used it once at the start ignored it for the rest of the game. 
I quite like the progression system. Very similar to final fantasy 10. The story is ""meh"". Nothing wrong with it but completely forgettable.

There are a few difficulty issues, the damage from some attacks is high enough to be a one-shot (or quite nearly), but potions and food are plentiful so if you survive a hit, healing up isn't that difficult. This makes for a weird balance where most of the game is rather easy, but you run into some severe spikes when you don't expect it.

There are only a couple of issues/glitches with the game. One of them isn't so much of a gamebreaking issue as it is helpful, but one particular error happened with the exploding skeleton enemies. 

Got hit by a dynamite at close range, and everything in the screen began moving in a slow motion style. I know it wasnt my computer because these were not frame drops. Pressing the menu button brings up the menu , which wasn't slow at all. After about a minute or two of waiting to hit the ground in hopes of the speed returning to normal, I hit the ground, but, whale..... everything was oofing slow. It was a good thing I saved a couple of minutes earlier. Only solution I know to the issue is to load up your save again via the menu. This has only ever happened once, so I'm not too worried about it. Just hoping it was a one time thing as a result of very random conditions being met.

That aside, buy the game. Pretty good fun and price.

I'll be perfectly honest in saying that this is a GOOD game. Not a great one and certainly far from perfect. But regardless it's a game that I would recommend to people who are a fan of the Genre. 
I think the most damning element is that the game doesn't bring anything fresh or new to the staple. I can't see anything here that I haven't seen before in some fashion. But oddly enough I enjoy the game regardless. 

The artstyle I think is what most attracted me to trying this out to begin with. It's very similar to Dragon's Crown aka George Kamitani whose art is fucking phenomenal. That's about all I can say with the Art. Some stuff looks good, other stuff needed a fresh start.

The music is... well interesting. For the most part it's your rather stereotypical fantasy/tribal stuff but mixed with metal. Which meshes pretty well with the artstyle and gameplay. Especially having this metal track to jam to while fighting bosses, I've just always loved that sort of thing. In comparison to other indie companies I think it's a good effort, considering that the soundtrack is easily overlooked whereas it should be considered one of the more important aspects.
There's also like two party-trance songs thrown in? It's honestly extremely jarring hearing these. Did the composer make them and just need to release them somewhere? It really doesn't fit the punk-fantasy setting that it's placed in. The song is ""Secret Workshop"" if you wanna give that a go. Nothing is impressive on the OST as a whole. Songs don't need to be 50 second sessions that repeat over and over, it drives people crazy. I'll go ahead and say the Tribal type stuff was superb. Do more Donkey Kong Country type and less Party-Trance.

As for the plot. It exists.
It's pretty bad. The dialogue is cheap and often poorly written (translated?). It's pretty straightforward and you know all the 'twists' that will happen going forward. I do like some of the setting like about what Runewardens are and stuff. But otherwise most of it seems recycled from other fantasies. Runewardens were interesting because they broke that mold.

Now for the 'bad', which generally revolves around Game Balance and Quality of Life
-""Rifts"" get unlocked but don't get explained to the player
-Rifts are located in Boss Areas or around the Map but SOME are annoying to go and access (far from travel points)
-Rifts have no visual map icon
IMO Rifts should either get an icon on the map or have all of them readily accessible in a single area
I think farming is bound to happen in this genre. Increasing the price and increasing rewards while upping difficulty seems like a fair trade to decrease time spent mindlessly grinding. 
-Storyline Bosses have no reward
-Skyrim style healing (aka go into inventory and eat a thousand apples)
-Overpowered potions, like Max Rage when combined with a skill that channels infinitely until rage runs out seems like a reeeeal bad gameplan if you want people to take this game seriously. Especially when that skill is essentially a hurricane that kills everything.
-Skill Tree unlocks for mandatory skills like Double Jump
-Mana Costs in Skill Tree are too expensive, lots of skills are just non-worthwhile. Essentially forces farming on the player but this is also added on thanks to Storyline Bosses having no rewards. Why not a level-up system or drop an item for a single free unlock?
-Screen-locked combat scenarios that repeat past the first encounter
For the love of all that is good. Please never do this again, rerunning through any area becomes a chore. Or better yet have a 'story-mode' area and after it's completed have it unlock as 'free-roam' with different arrangements of enemies.

And despite all this there actually is some sort of skill involved in the game. There are areas only accessible by combining a double jump with a jump attack special combo which I thought was insanely cool. (Or at least that was the only way I knew how to access those areas). I also really enjoyed there being secret rooms. More of this please!

I wanted to write this review immediately after completion to give it the best analysis I could but I've waited well over a month before writing my thoughts. So for that reason I probably have more to say but just can't recall everything.
I still stand by my opinion of this game being pretty Good overall and worth your money. I mean look at all the ridiculously overpriced Indie games thrown on Steam. The Devs CONSTANTLY put this game on sale. It's on sale right now as I write this. AGAIN. And it's so so SO cheap.

I'm enjoying the combat, which starts off simple against wolves and rats and gets harder when the enemies use different attack patterns and come at you in different group compositions. There's four or five (can't remember sorry) difficulty levels. I'm playing on the second (hard) and especially the bosses give me a proper challenge.

Only thing I don't really like is that the game simply puts invisible walls in paths where you're not supposed to go yet. Other than that it's a fun game with its own unique identity.

Anyone who relishes and adores vanilla-ware's hand painted graphical style is in for a real treat here. Beyond immediate visuals you're getting a well crafted side scrolling action adventure rpg with a challenge that's just right. (Not too easy but not too hard either)

I saw several reviews mentioning The Vagrant's plot is lacking  and I must say I'm presently out of the loop with what makes a story ""good"" or ""bad"" these days. I found sell-sword Vivian to have good motivations for what she's doing and the rivalry between rune-wardens and academy battle mages is an interesting one. Certain characters will do things you don't expect them to whereas potential enemies can become friends and those who seem kind and helpful at first often have ulterior motives. While it can be argued there are plenty of grim-dark fantasy tropes they are handled with care here and are no more or less predictable,jarring, or out of place than they would be in say The Witcher universe as a prime example. Unless you have grown to detest fantasy yarns altogether (Including ones with more adult themes) than nothing about The Vagrant is remotely cringe worthy in the narrative department.

 Vivian herself has a typical constellation skill grid that's easy to understand. Usually upgrading her statistics and teaching her new abilities is reliant on collecting the mana-shards from fallen monsters and spending a certain amount of them to progress along a particular path of your choosing. This is occasionally made more frustrating by barring her advancement when a talent, super-attack,dodge maneuver, or boost not only requires mana shards but also a particular item. Luckily, the aforementioned artifacts are usually not too difficult to come across. Beyond that you can buy and trade curative items,gear,and weapons at various towns as well as catch up with gossip by talking to the various towns-folk. Ever the spunky nomad survivalist, Vivian can also cook food at a camp fire (With proper ingredients) and ""eventually"" forge her own nifty armaments. It is very standard rpg fare but combat is enjoyable and the lore of the surrounding realm is just interesting enough to keep you adventuring onward. Traveling is further aided by way-point stone tablets that gradually increase the scope of destinations you can instantly teleport to. (It bears mentioning you can also use camp-fires and these mystical tablets to save your progress)

 Bosses are challenging but not unfair. Usually when I lost it was because I was lacking sufficient potions or wasn't utilizing Vivian's various ways of leaping,sliding,attacking,and gracefully cartwheeling to my advantage. She's certainly not too slow,too stiff, or too fragile to handle the challenges before her. Everything is there at your finger-tips,it's just a matter of remembering all the amazing feats Viv can do. (Which end up being quite a lot of them actually)

All this is accompanied by a competent soundtrack that kids from my generation would call ""Pretty friggin Metal!"" and a price-point that makes you wonder if you actually bought this gem or you stole it!

 I would tell you if something in this game bothered me or was egregiously terrible but other than taking a tad long to boot up on my pc, ""nothing"" sticks out as poorly done or unfinished. That's quite the accomplishment for a rag-tag tiny indie developer house. Needless to say, I definitely look forward to their future projects!

You would be mistaken to go into this game with the expectation that this game has the polish or graphics of a professionals or other indie games like it with much more backing behind them... you'd probably enjoy this game more if you considered it a peek at what a small team (I think they were 3 when they began and the core team of 2 is now the only thing that continues to patch it) could accomplish despite all the hangups -- from a kickstarter that failed to get off the ground to the amount of labor they put in to a publisher that brought them to a larger audience but is ultimately vendoring their game for profit margins of likely pennies on the dollar. Its a fun and cute looking indie game and only costs a few bucks.

Here's my reaction after about 5 hours of play, I think I get the idea of the game. Story telling wise, its certainly not the best-- it tells a generic tale of a hero escaping a dark past fighting so and so to acquire some artifact for some NPC withholding another item or information she needs to progress through her journey. I became dislodged from the story after a while because while a lot happens (won't spoil it) its all very mundane. The cutscenes are also far and few between as the gaps in storytelling are filled with lots and lots of plowing through enemies. I still would like to see the story through to the end even if I'm not particularly fond of the characters who are very static.

Combat wise, its a lot of fun hacking and slashing through enemies, but I felt that it lacked a lot of strategy and the AI could be braindead at times. It didn't feel like sparring with living breathing enemies a la dark souls but I understand how difficult that would be to program in. The fact is, it just gets boring and repetitive after a while since you don't feel challenged by the enemies, but rather just mildly inconvenienced. I also felt that all enemies (other than special ones) should've been left to wander around in the open rather than sometimes randomly spawn and lock players to a battle zone until they were cleared. It felt so mechanical and forced and sometimes doesn't feel fun at all especially when traversing to earlier zones in the game. Boss fights are unique for the most part but I find that the bosses rely too much at times on ridiculously fast speed and spamming the screen with adds or projectiles to deal damage ot the players and if the player can dodge out of half the hits, they can still get by just spamming potions. I would have preferred a slowerer and steadier boss fight that relied more on stamina management and timing dodges/hits. With how ridiculously hyper the bosses are, you also miss out and how well animated and fantastically rendered they are.

As for the art--- I think its fantastic and gorgeous. I think the animations are also well done and flashy and could easily keep players amused for hours. The background art is patchy at times though-- it turns from a beautifully rendered digital painting into a finger drawing and that broke the immersion. I understand that due to limited resources, they couldn't get the graphics to where they wanted it to be, but it was definitely an eyesore at times to see those inconsistencies and I feel terrible for pointing this out since 75% of the game graphics are really well done.  You don't get many cosmetic customizations aside from sword appearances and animations and fx for the moves you acquire as you upgrade Vivian.

The RPG systems are pretty standard, with stats being affected by the gear you wear and how you choose to spec your skill/talent tree. Gold is used to buy gear/food/stuff + upgrade gear which can also unlock bonus effects/stats and Mana is used to unlock more of the skill tree. Monsters drop both when defeated. I thought the progressions was fairly well calibrated without having to grind.

Traversing through the world is a little tedious as well. I think it feels a little fragmented with so many different ""rooms"" rather than one long seamless level and the transitions at times can through you off because not only do you have the bg artwork change dramatically at times but also the time of day they are set. The world just feels that much less cohesive in that manner. And it is even more broken up by the mobs that spawn in that you are forced to fight.

Recommending this game because the dev team's story is inspirational, because the game is just fun to pick up on occasion, because I want a sequel or at least another game from these devs that polished all of the above regions that I criticized and ultimately because I like amateur work that had more effort and love put into it than million dollar backed AAA titles.

As a BIG fan of the Vanillaware artstyle, this game really does scratch that itch for me on the PC as this game boasts some really incredible artwork. The artists eulatedreally got that nicely painted look down wonderfully! And while the animations aren't quite as refined, for what The Vagrant is, it gets the job done well enough! Some may be put off by the character designs (especially since most of the female characters are sporting quite a bust), but like I mentioned before, I love it to bits.

Combat in this game is a very satisfying, though it doesn't branch out too far from the hack n slash nature from what I played. There did seem to be some variety regarding more magic based combat however can't say much since I didn't explore too much on that front. Still, the RPG elements are on display with a variety of weapon and element types to consider, as well as a pretty straightforward upgrade tree system. Leveling in general never seemed to be as issue, in regards to the game feeling like a grind, though there are potential scenarios where it might feel a tad grindy.

I'd say the most lackluster aspect of the game would be its story. It's not too terribly engaging and felt oddly paced. The dialogue was ok, but was just kinda eh. It got what it needed to get across, I feel. And though the development of the characters was a little lacking too, I feel it was good enough to give SOME characterization to feel their plight.

Overall, a fun game that can be a little frustrating at times. Considering I bought this game for about $4, it was well worth it. Also, for some reason, there are people having an issue with the fact that the main character is busty and bounces. If that's an issue for you, then please just avoid this game and go play something else.  Everything is not made for everyone and doesn't need to be.

It looks very well hand-painted, with storyline and action adventure sidescroller gameplay, rpg elements as topping. Feels good as well smashing the enemies.

Graphics and art are hand drawn but majority of background images is are a blurry mess. 
The game have way too small variety of animations per character too. 

Dialogue script is quite good despite being full of fluff.

Both story and enemy/NPC design is quite unique and... very ""anime"" if you  know what I mean. In both good and bad meaning of that word.

Majority of boss fights are very good and far more challenging than any fight with normal enemies that you can just button mash to win. 
The only reason to not use X,X,X combos on bosses is because advanced combos are way stronger. 

For a simple, cheap indie game its a solid good game but its gets boring a bit too fast, especially that this game is 15-20 hours long. 
You will end up running around with open map, skipping fights way more often than actually fighting just to not waste more of your time. To be fair combo system is quite big variety of moves and doing any other combo than X,X,X is overall better in term of damage than X,X,X. 
Shame that this games doesn't have a list of possible combos. 
Its kinda hard to track all of them and their names, especially when you want to upgrade one of them. 

Also long unskippable cutscenes. F*ck off with that dev. Its not year 2000 anymore.

The map is a hot confusing garbage listing boss fights that you did kill, all save points as the same symbol (and there are two different: one that allow you to cook and one to teleport) and it doesn't list merchants at all. 

Its kinda like Metroid map from first game but far worse in term of layout. 
Is this part on map a forest or a castle? 
Where do I need to go to reach last village? 
I am on top right of map, next room and now I am on the bottom of it? 
Didn't I explored this room already? Oh wait, its just the same copy pasted room for 5th time. 
If you are in different zone then reach ""go here"" marker - the map won't even tell the direction you need to go. 

""The Rifts in Wesandyth Kingdom have been unlocked"". 
Cool, mind showing me the way? No?
I guess I need to waste another 30 minutes running around the whole forest once again to find it. 
How does a Rift even look a like? 
I have no idea. 10 hours in the game and I still didn't found a single Rift.
They are supposed to be in random places after finishing the zone and in short you spend money in them to get a difficult fight and have change to earn some good stuff.

Well...the fight is always laughable easy and you get barely anything so you just end up wasting money because its way more profitable to just walk around final zone, unless you gonna have good random drop luck.

Music and sound effects are very generic and there is nothing special or memorable about them. 
Heck, huge majority of them are just stock sound effects and some of them may be stolen
because I doubt that developers have right to use that obvious super Godzilla roar from the Godzilla movie released in 2014. 

In average game music goes on the loop every 3/4 minutes to not get dull fast enough but unfortuned in Vagrant the music goes on 30 or 60 second loop making it way more irritating and annoying to listen after few minutes of playing. 
It feels more like the music was running on a broken record.

Platforming in this game is pure garbage. I have no words how bad it is. 
Character is too floaty sliding from every platform, basic jumping is fixed without aerial control (similiar to early Castlevania games), 
you need to dash (double forward press) before every jump, 
there are unexpected traps everywhere and one enemy attack is enough to push you down making you do everything all over again.
Sometimes infinite spawning flying ghosts will be harrasing you, sometimes random arrow will knock you out of the platform. 
At least you can unlock ""double jump"" and ""air dodge"" quite early and better do it fast.
It won't help much with enemies but you will get a bit more aerial control.

I did encounter lots of glitches but nothing annoying or progress ruining. 
The most common thing that happen are: 
unloaded background textures, 
missing sound effects, 
sound effects that playing on loop until you move to the next screen,
low framerate during some fights (especially when enemies use teleporting or ""magic"" circles), 
sometimes the game got stuck at 20-40 frames per second until you will change the screen, 
music being way louder than it should be in random places and enemies standing still
and doing nothing after being hit. 
Sometimes those glitches will fix themself after being hit again, 
sometimes not and you can easy get killed by them. 

For a simple 15 hour long 2D game that spend so many years in early access this is kinda pathethic if you ask me. Developers, fix your damn game!

Also the story is so nuts.
You will get couple of good laughs on possible one of the most ridiculous and dumbest anime bullcrap story ever. 
Why? Well, let's start with the fact that every single female character have oversized boobs. Like really oversized. 

Heck,I don't even know if those English lines of dialogue are intended to be like that or it's just terrible translation...wait
""You find holy water""? 
Nevermind...its just terrible translation.

Additionally I want to point how disappointing, terrible and confusing is the final zone that is nothing but platforming and walking into dead ends. 
Its almost like it was build around wasting your time considering that the whole zone is way smaller than any previous zone. 
Hmmm. Oh, also its filled with nothing but reused enemies. They don't even deal much damage, they just have lots of health and swarm you in group to make sure you wont have even chance to dodge them. 
Very original idea to ruin your final hours of game I must say. 
At some points you even meet same looking enemies that just have increased stats.
This one guy have 3 times faster attack and walking animation and this bowman have 10 times more health for no reason but just to annoy you with his constant arrows. 

There is also ""the best farming spot in the game"" as you can call it it and its just ""Rift rush"" aka ""boss rush but those bosses are 2 times faster and throw extra bullshit at you while infinite spawning enemies flood the screen"". 
Oh, you died during 4th boss because he have instant kill projectile? Well, too bad - you spend 15 minutes and get nothing for that. 

In short: this is how you NOT make a final level in the game. 
It feels way too much like ""oh uh - we need to release this game out of early access so lets quickly mash out a zone and fill it with reused assets and reused boss fights"". 

Same goes with ""side quest for true ending"". 
Just feels like another dumb decision made in last week before game was going out of early access. You need to fight 5 optional dull and uninteresting boss fights in order to get ""true ending"". 
Oh and those bosses are completely pushovers and you have zero transition or build up for them. 1 of them you find randomly in second to last zone and killing him unlocks fight with other 3 of them and you just supposed to find them them in previous zones because they have keys to open that one special door. 
Also good luck finding them without a guide. Just another way to waste your time. 
Inside that door is the last boss who at least doesn't die after 10 hits but its a reused boss you figh on the start of the game.
Heck, all boss fights in the last zone are beyond pathethic, dying from just few Tornado's.
And all what ""true end"" does is to give you a post credits (unskippable credits because why not) 1 minute long extra dialogue.

I still recommend this game because how sometimes bat sh*t it gets. 
The combat system is enjoyable enough, majority of boss fights are fun to fight and the game has some unique gameplay ideas. 
Its just shame how the whole end part of the game was shoved in without any sort of thought or reason.",1535825164,1601455077

I should have paid attention to how many of those reviews focused heavily on the value of the game due to the low price. While it is fair that you'll get a game that isn't broken to fill your time with a decent dollar per hour of gameplay spent value, I happen to believe that there are more important things than the dollar you spend per hour.

Before moving on to the negatives, in addition to the price I would also like to add that I do like the art style a fair bit. While the animated characters and enemies are shoddily animated and the main character is over sexualized, the rest of the world is beautifully hand drawn. I very much liked the look of the world and the characters that are not animated. A lot of the frames and locations are composed quite beautifully.

However, the blending of mediocre beat em up with an exploration RPG is a poor one. The pacing is painful as The Vagrant frequently puts up artificial walls forcing you to sit in a single area combating its enemies. This exacerbates a lot of what would otherwise simply be mediocre about the game... things like poorly balanced enemies that take way too much button mashing to kill for how difficult they are, repetative and sluggish combat, and subpar enemy design in general. It puts these elements front and center, traps you with them, and says that this is what you need to pay attention to the most.

It's a mechanic that I dislike even in a much better constructed game, but that pain is increased by the quality of the elements around it. While you do have a diversity of attacks, your best bet is to just button mash the general attack button for the most part. A power attack will do more damage, but will leave an enemy invulnerable on the ground for a few seconds prolonging the fight. You can jump to dodge attacks, but your jump, at least in the early game, is low and many of the enemies that you actually need to jump over are quite tall making it a risky tactic, especially due to how cumbersome the jump controls are.

At least from a design perspective the games core mechanics are reflected in its larger design. Yes, the fights are sluggish and repetative, but at least in that sense by forcing you to fight its challenges in sequential arenas the game embraces that sluggish and repetative is its defining feature. There is definitely a market for this. Beat Em Ups are a market staple, and if that type of game is your jam, this is going to be okay. In fact, the exploration elements, shallow as they are, are an improvement on that genre and may be appreciated by an audience who is satisfied with this. 

I feel that there are better beat-em-ups, though, and that the genre has found ways to add differences in kind to its gameplay and pacing to its flow so that games like this don't hold up by comparison. I cannot see myself playing this game to completion. For its few positives, it just too heavily embraces and forces me to sit through its biggest flaws, and I don't have time for that. But note, that's frequently an issue with the genre. So, if you're fine with games that frequently block you in and have you mash X for a minute before letting you move on to the next block, this game will probably be okay for you. 

I wouldn't recommend it, though.",1535718110,1535718110

The Vagrant came to my attention as it so much reminds me of the good old Amiga days where parallax scrolling was something special, especially when it was smooth and without stutters! The beautiful hand made background graphics also add wonderfully to that retro feeling. But of course The Vagrant is not only a simple sidescroller hack and slash that you finish in two hours. It took me about 12 hours from start to the last boss, and it's featuring quite a lot of role play elements, like lots of weapons and armor (armor=  one glove :D) that can be upgraded in multiple says, character stats, a surprisingly big skill tree, many bosses and tons of loot. Even the story is not so bad for a side scroller! The Vagrant is always fair, some bosses can be challenging, but it's never over the top. Overly fair save points make you wonder why you can't just save anywhere in the game. The soundtrack is real nice as well, and the best thing is: The Vagrant actually has replay value! Not only to get all those grindy achivements, but actually because there is new cool stuff to discover when you are close to the final boss.. and decide to teleport all the way back to the beginning. I was surprised how much I enjoyed my second walkthrough. The only cons that I can think of are a few minor bugs (nothing game breaking... just one hint: at some point you WILL need the ""double jump"" or you'll indeed be stuck in one spot so you oughta unlock this ability as soon as you can) and sometimes the controls seem a bit unresponsive.

HOWEVER- after completing one whole playthrough getting the good, bad, yet somehow not the normal ending, I can say that it was worth the money and time. EVEN FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME, who tried to look at the MAIN DAMN CHARACTER as LITTLE as possible throughout the, like, 12 hours of play. 

I do think you could even enjoy it more than I did if you just skip every single dialogue box in the game. The story is almost depressingly weak, cringeworthy at times even.

Moving paintings you could say. From the early predecessors like Princess Crown, to classics like Odin's Sphere, Muramasa and Dragon's Crown, Vanillaware has earned a place in hearts of many gamers... on consoles.

Their absence on the PC platform is quite noticeable (one can only imagine how awesome Dragon's Crown multiplayer would be with friends), however, all is not... doom and gloom!

Enter O.T.K. Games who attempts to fill this void by a Vanillaware-inspired game in terms of gameplay, structure and visuals, but still having its own little spin in parts. When you decide to walk the path of  a developer with such a distinct style, you better make it worth it! And surprisingly, O.T.K. passes the test with flying colors!

The Vagrant is an amazing looking game with equally satisfying gameplay to keep you entertained for quite a few hours.
Taking the role of Vivian, our admittedly buxom heroine, you traverse a wide variety of locations, from lush forests and  dark caves, to castles, mountains and many more - (the variety of locations keep the experience very fresh until the end), listening to some epic tunes and hacking and slashing your way though a wide variety of enemies, from heavy armored knights, to the most creepy eldritch abominations. 

To do this you will need to level up Vivian, choosing from a huge skill tree of various abilities, equiping various armor and weapons and using all kinds of trinkets with different abilities. At first the battle seems very basic, but as you unlock more skills and abilities the combat system against the more tougher enemies starts to shine, giving you the opportunity to perfom some really powerful combos.

There is also a system of enhancing and enchanting weapons with various runes, and while this ended up not being such a big focus of the game, there were still some quite powerful runes that proved to be of great help and gave room to experimenation.

The maps are big, offering plenty of exploration and rewards. Of course what would exploration be without taking a rest and eating some delicious food with the cooking mechanic with each recipee you obtain offering different buffs for your character.

There is a possibility that some might get bored fighting minions constantly, however, the boss battles are quite exceptional and the highlight of the game. Huge bosses, with many different attack patterns, a wide variety of designs and some of them requring a helathy amount of quick reflexes and patience, giving me some arcade-style-Dark-Souls vibe! Although never becoming extremely difficult, there were situations that ended up in a Game Over, but for most of the time I managed to maintain my character's HP  (health pick ups were plenty in each stage!)
But keep in mind I played it on Normal Difficulty so I guess on harder modes things will become even more dangerous.

So pay attention to the skills, make sure you explore every room [spoiler] and make sure to get the true ending after doing some optional quest with some optional bosses [/spoiler] to get the most out of the experience.

And to keep things even more interesting, we have our obligatory optional dungeon/extremely hard bosses and a NG+ after you finishg your adventure.

The game ran quite smooth on my PC, i didn't encounter many glitches besides a few minor things here and there and the translation is a ages ahead compared to the Early Access version though a couple of typos were still present. Nothing much to complain really.

Vivian's story is quite an interesting one, a bit of mystery, a dark past, vengeance, you know the drill! A quite entertaining, action-packed and sometimes somber story.

With so much content, polished gameplay, wonderful soundtrack, and grat art and animation, fast satifying combat and an interesting story, it is quite baffling that such a proffessional game is offered in such a low price! If you are a fan of this genre and style of games do yourself a favor and get this game. A really fun and rewarding  experience worthy of your time!

This is the best Vania game I've played since Aria Of Sorrow.
Exploration, multitude of weapons, armors, items, upgrades, skills, etc etc,
plus a really cool upgrade system that is... complicated, but easily understood at the same time. Layered, rather than convoluted. It has pretty graphics, nice use of colors, you can always tell what is going on, 
and the thing that stood out to me most was how the combos are actually... doable. I grew up on PC, so controllers are kinda new to me overall, but I am able to pull off even the crazy complex jump+direction+light+light+heavy type combos with ease. I would guess that's because of it being a bit forgiving on the timing of the taps (whereas a LOT of games refuse to accept combos if you're one milisecond off. ugh.) 
I actually saved and stopped playing just so I could write this review: I love it. it has literally been put in my Favorites category now. I'm having a blast! It really does feel like playing Aria of Sorrow again. monster hunting, exploring the world, retracing your steps, finding hidden secrets, rewarding exploration, decent lore and characters, its GREAT.

and what astounds me is i got this on sale for something like 60 cents... having now played it, I would have gladly paid 60 DOLLARS. this game is GREAT!!! 

...and for those of you who are worried about ""over sexualization"" etc... to be honest, ....I don't notice? like, yeah, she has large breasts, but, there's no fanservice camera angle stuff, no sex jokes, no... nuthin, really. It's just there. it's her genetics: she has large breasts. oh well. no big deal. It really neither adds nor detracts from anything. her moves aren't sexualized (think bayonetta or similar) armor upgrades actually are real actual armor, not nipple tassels or something.... so, really, I don't think even the quite prudish need worry. 

it's violent and serious enough in plot and world to merit a ""don't let your child play this"" type thing, but, its not because of boobs. 

but frankly, ignore the sexuality advetising, and just appreciate it for what it is: a new aria of sorrow to explore and enjoy! proper Vanias are way too rare, and this IS a proper vania.

With an artstyle and gameplay that apes Vanillaware games, it's a pretty game that provides a fulfilling, if somewhat shallow, first playthrough.  Add in multiple endings and a new game plus with some end game content, and it's a steal at the price it launched at.

Coming back to the presentation, the art is maybe a little more rough than Odin Sphere or Dragon's Crown.  Backgrounds especially look significantly less detailed than the characters and enemies.  Regardless, the game paints a pretty picture and you never lose your character in clutter or by blending in to the background.  The visuals are interesting without being distracting.

Story is reasonably engaging, providing a dark plotline that follows numerous tragedies and calamities in service of the main plot.  With the game being only 6-7 hours for a playthrough, the narrative doesn't have time to get stale.  It's thoroughly serviceable, though is sometimes marred by some minor translation errors in the text.

The controls a reasonably tight.  It has a combo system that evolves as you unlock skills and find items.  Though it has some customization, it's not to a very deep level.  Serviceable is probably the best way I could describe it how much variability with your combat choices.  Hitting enemies is always satisfying, even if you often use the same skills and combos over and over.

That's what strikes the player first.
Then, as you move on, levelling up becomes mandatory and the game does that well making grinding and farming not too much of a chore, that is unless you want the best equipment the game offers which isn't required to finish the game anyway.
Story is OK, told through beautiful artwork and OK dialogues, OK character development.
With that out of the way, let's talk about combat. It's pretty satisfying, as you unlock new moves and abilities, you really start kicking ass if you choose wisely, your Vagrant becomes unstoppable and like I said, it's quite satisfying and that's what matters in this game: dealing more and more damage until you really unlock  her true potential, it's worth it.
The RPG element is on and off with this game, not too hard, not too easy, easy access to anyone and the game offers this metroidvania vibe since you're very likely to re-visit areas to discover new things.
I had a blast playing it, replaying it, well worth the price.
With real emphasis on combat and inventory management, it's unlikely you'll finish the game without dying quite a few times and wanting more, given you play it on hard from the get-go.

However, while far from a bad game, you might find several issues during your playthrough. Foregrounds and music suddenly missing. Some mistranslations (Although the story is quite straightforward). During the first half you can talk NPCs several times for different lines, yet in late game NPCs will spew all of it from a single interaction making you wonder why the devs didn't go with the latter. These are some noticeable problems I found, yet not that hurtful in the overall experience.

What really is a problem is some decisions they took with the gameplay. There's a very small window of invulnerability when being hit, so there might be some situations where enemies will stack several attacks together and becoming lethal in some cases given the game has a potion cooldown/penalty system. Often suffers from the problem of drop systems where you'll get a strong item to then get a better one in a few minutes later, making spending resources (Specially runes) a waste in some scenarios. The difficulty curve is all over the place specially with the frame trap problem mentioned earlier. But the biggest problem is that with many areas being vertical and requiring platforming, various traps and enemies will become extremely annoying and even make you drop to the bottom. I heard there are some issues to obtain the true ending, so try to keep a free slot to save your game just in case.

If the game fixed some of its problems and put a bit more effort on its cutscenes (As various events are mentioned in parenthesis) it could have been a prime example of its genre. However, although I focused on its issues and problems I had with it is far from being too flawed to enjoy. If anything it might require learning the battle system (That is if you're not familiar with similar games) and manage resources wisely, as nonetheless is a great game that is worth its time.",1534354856,1534354856

Great game, I have never recommended a game at full price so this will be the first time I will,

This game was the first reviewed game I saw from one of my favorite youtubers MediaGlitch, the name itself caught my attention since it reminded me of Vagrant Story from Squaresoft and the artstyle was similar too. Although many people say this game is a lot like Vanillaware games, it reminded me a lot of Dust an Elysian Tail and also it made me think a little of Legend of Mana, another Squaresoft game btw. It has a little of Valkyrie Profile too. I have played it around 2 hours so far and the game seems good, it's not amazingly good but it's good enough, I would have to put it on Dust: an Elysian Tail or Valdis Story: Abyssal City level.

I am currently loving this game even though I've only played about halfway(?) through  the game.
I tried using both keyboard and controller controls. The controls for the keyboard are quite abysmal, but it reccomends a controller anyways. In contrast, the controller controls are quite easy to learn and play. Even a person that is terrible at sidescrolling games (like me) can play this game and still enjoy it. I also enjoy the generous checkpoints/savepoints. This makes it so that you can learn a boss' moveset and therefore figure out how to beat them. 

This game is definitley one of my favourites, and it's pretty nice to the wallet too. For only $4, this is amazing how good it is. I also like how there is not really a level system, but instead it's a gain exp to buy skills and stat increases. I also notice some attention to detail, where some weapons swing faster than others, which makes sense, because it's a heavy ice sword versus a lightning sword. The graphics are not the greatest, but graphics aren't everything, and it's the enjoyablility of the game. 

One thing that I wish the game has is an easier way to grind exp, because I am the kind of person that likes to over-level themself. They already have specific items you need to have in order to unlock some abilities, but it renders this feature useless by putting a limit on something that is hard to do anyways. The way that you have to grind is that you have to save and load your save file over and over again in order to kill enough enemies to overlevel yourself.

it was originally a kick-starter game and it had some rough development years, you will notice when you play the game  they could have made it so much more.

But is The Vagrant a good game when ignoring the low price tag? Yes it is, a great one!

While I am generally not too fond of games developed in China (Generally simple and repetitive gameplay, low originality, lots of timesinks) by personal taste, this one really stood out by its shining qualities.
It is very clear how much the devs love Vanillaware. The aesthetics and gameplay are just like what you could find in an Oboro Muramasa, Odin Sphere or Dragon's Crown. Almost similar quality and polish, astounding!

[b]Here's some info and a quick rundown of its pros and cons[/b]:
Difficulty: Very challenging (Chosen difficulty level: Hard)
Playthrough time: Around 11 hours for the average playthrough with a bunch of retries
Replayability: NewGame+ and different endings. Die & Retry as well as grind are present if you want to really get the most out of your playthrough.

[h1]PROS:[/h1]
+ Visually stunning hand-drawn art, George Kamitani would be proud!
+ Outside of bossfights, combos rule the world. If you're a combo nerd like me stop reading and buy it.
+ Really varied and fitting soundtrack. Not really memorable but decent nonetheless.
+ Decent, simple story that doesn't try to take the spotlight away from the gameplay while delivering enough feels to keep you entertained.
+ Finally a game where your inventory items don't just rot away but SAVE YOUR FAT BOTTOM! Scavenge for secrets and you'll have enough Adrenaline pickups to make any boss reconsider their life choices.
+ Boss-specific game overs/bad endings! They are minor but still worth the mention!
+ Given how loudly certain people scream about bikini armor & large breasts, such an over-the-top, badass design is a bold move from the devs that is assumed in its entirety. I told you they loved Vanillaware heh!
+ Lots of content for such a cheap and low-scale game!
+ Really challenging and fun as f*ck combat in general.

[h1]CONS:[/h1]
- Unskippable cutscenes, very frustrating.
- Large difficulty spikes on some bosses (especially a certain recurring boss you will recognize)
- Bosses have very few attack startup and recovery frames, making bossfights very unforgiving in general, forcing you into a defensive playstyle and forbidding you from using combos, as they are not affected by any hitstun besides the ""grace"" period between phases. Best way to punish and damage a boss without using rage is to use a grounded heavy attack.
The only other way around is to abuse the full invincibility you get when using rage skills. Rage & adrenaline potions can make an entire bossfight jokingly easy when used correctly.
- In lategame (Hard+) defense and maxlife almost mean nothing, at that point any boss attacks 1-2shots you. In many situations, one mistake and it is over.
- One terrible design choice: The talent tree, while being a concept I really love and that adds a lot to the game, has talents that are MANDATORY IN ORDER TO ADVANCE IN THE GAME. Double jump, double dodge, airdodge can NOT be ignored, as from mid to late game you are supposed to be able to reach doublejump platforms, and most boss attacks cannot be evaded in a single dodge. The game implicitely recommends you to take these, but for some players this wouldn't be clear enough.
- Cooking is underwhelming
- Rift rewards are too small given the difficulty of boss rifts.
- Lots of Mana grind if you want to max out Vivian and her gear",1533350109,1533350205

I played it straight through in one sitting and it took me about nine hours to beat with some running around and grinding and I enjoyed all of it.

Firstly, beautiful artwork. Everything looks gorgeous and reminds me of Dragon's Crown(which i'm guessing was part of the inspiration). And yes the women are absurdly buxom but if it's not the only selling point of a game I really don't care. The detail is beautiful(especially on Vivian's muscles. Again, no shame.) and I couldn't find one bad piece of artwork or anything that didn't look like it fit.

Next up, gameplay. It's simple but fun. I never got tired of the combat which is super important in these kind of games, though it did get a bit annoying dealing with so many flying enemies towards the end who barely dropped anything useful(not counting the Eyes). I love the upgrade system because it's not too complicated and I always looked forward to my next fight after each new upgrade and purchase. The platforming isn't too bad and I never got frustrated with a platforming section. The only real complaint I have is with status effects not showing up on the HUD(Or maybe they do and i've been blind for the last nine hours).

And in regards to the story I honestly wasn't sure what to expect. But I was happy to see that the translation was pretty darn good with just a few contextual issues. I liked the world that was put together here and while the story had some awkward moments here and there I was pretty into it. But I have to say I was pretty disappointed with the true ending. There were so many questions left unanswered and created by the ending and I didn't feel like I had the closure I was looking for with it. It had a nice buildup but the payoff felt a bit rushed, like they ran out of time to give a proper send off. And I hope we get to see this world and Vivian again in the future with a bit more answers next time.

This game is easily worth 5-10. You can beat the story in probably around 7-8 hours however there are also quite a lot of side things you can do, even if you're a casual gamer it should be doable since I do not play many of these types of games and I managed with it very well. Lots of weapons and other items to find and just lots of cool optional content so you could probably spend a good 30+ hours on this game if you really wanted to do everything there is to do, there's even new game plus so more replayabilty. The graphics are a nice, the combat and character movement is fluid and very satisfying, the sound and music is pretty good and just overall the game is pretty solid. I only have a couple issues with it, the first being some of the enemy hitboxes are very annoying, sometimes you get hit by something that isn't that close to you, also since the maps seems to connect to one another its possible for long range enemies to shoot you through walls so you have to be cautious about that. Also there doesn't seem to be a map of any kind so sometimes it is very confusing and you might get lost and its also very possible to miss rooms and items because of it, if this game had a proper map then this would be a solid 10/10 game for me, well, it would also help if it had voice acting rather than just text boxes. The game also has a few bugs here and there but no big problems. Overall though a pretty sweet game and for the price its definitely worth picking up. 8.5/10.",1532785467,1532785467

In the beginning of the game, you start with barely any moveset and move up by leveling up and gain plent eventually. You play as one character through out the whole game. Side scroll levels. Very beautiful game to the likes of Vanilla Ware titles if you like those visuals. Convient save points at key points. Plenty of bosses.

Off screen cheap shots-sometimes enemies shoot immediate laser or projectiles that sweep and are too fast to react to out of sight. ( mostly at the final stage )

The story isn't anything unique, but it's kinda fun to try and spot all of the nods and references to other works of fiction in the fantasy genre, including, but not limited to The Lord of the Rings and Dark Souls.

2 hours in, first impressions:  Seems like a solid enough if fairly basic game.  Combat oriented with some development but the skill tree is not exactly Path of Exile standard.  Some slow loading sections.  7 achievements so far without much effort.  Reasonable mini-boss fight.  I am a little confused about certain things but I am sure they will become clearer, though the game does not explain much.

10 hours in:  Well it is a fine game, good compulsive gameplay but just ran into a hellish boss fight.  Turns out some of the things I was not sure about at first are in a tutorial section (just notes) through the pause menu, so not quite so mystifying.  15 achievements now but I think progress is definitely going to be slower.  The skills in the game develop well but it would be nice if the item purchasing/selling prices were in some way comparable rather than eg 35k to buy and 1k to sell to trader.

30 hours in:  34 achievements so far and a few more look easy enough to get.  This is quite a fine game.  It will never challenge the games like Shadow of Mordor or Assassins Creed but it makes for a diverting little game.  The mapping system is a bit weird at first but my only real complaint is the slow loading time when you switch regions or load a save file.  Seems an odd decision in this era of gaming to not have auto-saves.

Still, I would firmly recommend this.",1532720864,1534898576

Vanillaware is the best at what they do, which is gorgeous 2-d adventures. Vagrant, for 4 dollars, is this but on the cheap and for that price, it is absolutely worth it.

When I first saw this game, Dragons Crown with the combonation of Dust to Dust came to mind stratight away (and no its not just beacuse of the overly sexualised characters.) The artstyle is so beautifully done and the games plot is griping right from the get go. As a side scrowling RPG it can be a great casual game to play with the minimum difficulty at normal. 

My first playthrough lasted about 8-9hours on normal and i had got to the second to last areas without some of the basic key items i needed to levelup. Speacking of which the attribute tree is an awesome way to grow your character via spending mana and the requirement of certain items to get further up the tree allows for exploration, finding every hidden area. 

The battle mechanics mostly consit of combing heavy and light attacks with the skill attacks, which consume rage, sets up for some repertition but with the random encounters of tough mobs, it keeps you on your toes so your more worrid on survival. All the bossess are challenging at first but there patterns are easy enough to get a hold of. So if you really want a challenge then i would play this on lunatic.

There are extras in the game to challenge you and spead up leveling but the downside as you could tell is how short it is to completion (although I would imagine on a higher diffuclulty I would get more bang for my buck).

I found it through a related suggestion underneath another game I was looking at (can't remember which one.) Glad I decided to check it out. When I picked it up it was half off so $1.99 and honestly that price is something that I pretty much expect to be an absolute terrible experience most of the times.

I should start this off by mentioning that I am an incredibly huge vanillaware fan. Absolutely loved odin sphere, muramasa, dragon's crown. Even played through grand knights history via a fan translation. (Grand Kingdom was a pretty fun game too.) This game - As far as I know seems to be heavily influenced by VanillaWare judging from the art style and gameplay. That's not a bad thing since more vanillaware is always good :) (Can't wait for 13 Sentinels. )

With that out of the way within this game I found an incredibly flawed but great game. It definitely isn't perfect but it has an amazing challenge and an interested story to tell throughout the surprisingly lengthy game. As long as you go through and see most things it has to offer: I've completed all side/main bosses. Obtained the true ending while also finally beating the dungeon of the decayed. 

This gem should take you around 10 hours minimum to complete which is saying something for a damn near free experience.

I also recommend a controller just as the devs do but I did play a little over half of the game through with just a keyboard (It is doable.) 

Absolutely recommend this as long as you understand it is not perfect. It'll give you more than enough content and fun if you can get past the start. The bosses are varied and challenging. I've gotten stuck on a few of them and had to learn some attack patterns to be able to win. The combat is lacking in the beginning but that gets resolved rather quickly once more skills get added to your abilities. Late game I'm practically dashing and flying around the screen murdering enemies (Reminds me of Muramasa a lot in that way.)

Pick it up full price. It's $4 bucks. Not many things you can buy with that and I certainly didn't expect a 14 hour game with that price. and if that is even too much for you - Like I mentioned before I picked it up for half off so this game while already cheap still has reasonable sales without trying to give itself away for free.

First: The game is highly recommended to play with a controller, but the movement things are super sensitive towards up and down. To the point that I ended up talking with a villager three times while trying to walk past them, because my stick was slightly angled upwards when I ran into them. And multiple times during boss fights, my character inexplicably decided to duck while I was running because my stick tilted slightly down. Problems are somewhat mitigated by using the D-pad, but still there. 
The game also says in the tutorial that ""you can avoid most attacks by ducking."" The entire first area of the game is filled with wolves and rats, with an occasional boar mixed in. All of which are at knee height. I'm going to go ahead and assume that the ""Dodge"" button is slightly more useful in avoiding attacks than ducking.

Also, not a super major thing, but the text has a weird wrap-around issue, where there will be times that someone's speaking and you can see the text box twitching (it stops when the text is done being put in), or times where there will be like, 1 or 2 words on a line, with the rest of the sentence continuing below it. Very strange to see.
________________________

Enough of my being a bit of a downer though. The Game is really quite fun, with beautiful art. The story is a little iffy, but I'm not that far into the game's story. Controls are relatively simple to learn, which is always a plus in my book. I wish the directional sensitivity will get fixed soon, because the up-down issue is also a bit of a pain when dealing with activating special skills, so there will be times I want to use a forward-B Special, but use the wrong one due to my stick being pointed slightly down. :-X

All in all, a lovely game. I look forward to trying to finish it. <3",1531950812,1531950812

Here's the only hard negative I have against this game: the English textboxes feel like they are from a crappy mobile game. The translation itself is great, and I actually want to read it because the story is good. Any other text is also great, including dialog at the bottom during cutscenes. However, the text bubbles are written in what looks like basic Times New Roman, a bit too small for comfort, and the edge of the bubble janks a bit as text appears in it.

Everything else is EXCELLENT. You're basically playing 2D Devil May Cry. You continuously wail on meaty enemies that swing hard, roll-cancelling swiftly out of anything, carrying the smaller ones to the skies where you can continue your combos, guard breaking the larger ones to create windows of opportunity, doding and air dodging sh𝒾t left and right as it happens, all that good stuff. The controls and feel is as tight as any classic 9+/10 action game from the PS2 era and earlier. There's RPG stats to go around, too, and you have this huge skill tree that's much more generous than the equivalent upgrades in DMC. Good stuff.

The story hasn't blown my mind yet, but I actually want to read it, and I enjoy the dark fantasy tones. I figure I'm still a bit early in the game, but so far I've gotten a few Berserk vibes, and there's even this place that felt a bit Quintet, where you go into some ruins to get a magical thingy. Without spoiling much, you meet ghosts you can talk to along the way, but they are only reenacting bits of the past, so you can kind of figure out what ruined this place without it ever being 100% explicit. Or you can just dash in, ignore all of them and grab the thing. Judging from achievements and locked skills and such, it seems like it will run you 10~15 hours, and slow 𝒶ss gamers like myself 20 hours :P

So far I can't remember any of the soundtrack when I'm away from the game. They are mostly ambient, without a very strong melody or recurring motif to stick with you. Then from time to time it goes METAL like Symphony of the Night's Clock Tower. All in all, the soundtrack so far is a good time, and I would probably enjoy letting it run in the background of D&D games or freelance work.

And finally, graphics. Holy crap. Beautiful 2D sprites everywhere full of keyframes, classic SotN style noticeable ""tween"" on larger enemies' swings, not-so-uncommon gorgeous, monitor-encompassing splash screens of detailed views, and dreamy painted backgrounds that gradually become darker as you move further into the countryside and ruins of this land on the brink. This is the level of quality Valkyrie Profile would be at if it had been allowed to run in 1920x1080.

So TL;DR, this game is EVERYTHING you want, it's a steal at full price, don't let the janky text bubbles give you a bad impression, and holy sh𝒾t O.T.K games is only three people",1531865506,1531870712

iam recommending that game... but not because its good. I recommend it because its cheap and quite entertaining.

Pros:
- Combat ist nice

- Graphics is okay not the best but the Effects look cool enough

- The Swords look cool

- Protagonist has nice tits and sister too :D

Cons:
- The Skill System is not realy good. Its just too simple.

- The Grind is real... well  except you find out, that you can just grind the last room in the game before going to the final boss.
I just grinded the last room for an hour then i had the whole Passive SKills unlocked... and no archievement from steam... =(

- The Mana you gain thru the game is ridiculous low ( just grind the last room)

- The GOLD you earn.... dont know what to say. First town i enter was a merchant, he is selling a sword for 5MILLIONS !!! WTF!!!
At this point the upmost I had was 80k .... not even after ending a had this many money... and its not only that trolling. Later on the poitions costs 3K oder 4K each..... with 200k Gold you can barely buy 68 potions.

- the Rune System... thru the game ive had 8 runes... and i dont even know from what. Never got any more... Just save them for last boss on the best weapon. 

- Meal System cooking ... is so dump... you can cook meals yes, but its only one meal at a time and it can only be consumed on the fire place.... no rations for the run.... you dont even see the buffs on the ui.... 

- The Ending is.... dont know did i won or not... cant tell you: I think its a bad ending =(

Well then, this is the game for you. If the characters in Dust are animals who look like humans, the characters in this game are humans who don't look like humans. The ""anime sexualization"" filter has been applied over and over again, and everyone looks like a jiggling mass of curves and / or muscles and / or extra-large eyes. 

But that's fine. You get over it after a while. Eventually, you might even be able to forget that the main character doesn't seem to have nipples. It's the only plausible explanation for her sprite. And it corroborates the theory that these things shaped like people aren't actually people - they must be some sort of strange human-like fungus or something. 

The gameplay itself is good. The controls are excellent, the character is perfectly responsive. However, she's let down by uninspired enemy design. There's a bunch of different kinds of enemies, but they really boil down to three categories: light melee, heavy melee, and ranged. Light melee you need to dodge behind and hit, heavy melee you need to jump behind and hit, and ranged you dodge toward and hit. In theory you're supposed to use heavy attacks to knock down the shields of the heavy melee, but why bother? Just double-jump over them. 

And speaking of double jump, character advancement is partially done through a vaguely neat skill web - sort of a mini version of Path of Exile's skill tree system. The problem with it is that it's impossible to find anything. Want to make sure you've unlocked all the abilities on the skill tree? Too damn bad. You've got a bunch of tiny images and no legend, good luck. The other problem with it (and this is a problem with almost every skill tree ever made) is that 80% of the ""skills"" are ""+x to some stat"", which is super underwhelming. 

The other path for character advancement that's worth talking about involves finding, equipping and upgrading weapons, armor, and accessories. The weapons and armor are kinda neat; new weapons show up on your character, and you can pay to upgrade them out of the same currency you use to buy skills on the skill tree. There's runes and elemental damage and slotting and stuff, it's all about as expected. 

Unfortunately it turns out that armor does [b]not[/b] show up on your character, so she's doomed to wander the world in an implausible bikini. 

There's also skill tablets which you new skills you can use with your ""Rage"" (aka: mana, it's even refilled by blue potions), and you'll never use those skills because there's skills in the tree that give you bonus damage when your mana's full.

Aside from the fact that the people in this game have apparently been replaced with grotesque mycelial doppelgangers, the game's greatest weaknesses are the bosses and the backtracking. The backtracking is awful, especially because it's so simply fixed: just give players the option to fast-travel between campfires (instead of the fairly rare steles). It's not [i]that[/i] bad, especially since most basic enemies are dispatched easily, just annoying. 

As far as I've seen, the bosses are entirely mediocre. They're all unique, yes, that's a point in the game's favor, but they're all gigantic damage sponges. Each boss has at least three or four HP bars, and their attack patterns don't seem to change [i]at all[/i] during the fight. Once you've burned down a single HP bar, you've seen everything that boss has to offer - you just have to sit there and keep on killing it for another five minutes. 

If you're looking for an action RPG, and you've already played Dust (or don't like furries), play Icey. Then come and play this game. It's very good, despite its pod people.",1531628109,1531628109

Combat feels limited and repetitive, but it's not bad for like a 7 hour rpg that costs two dollars. You can cancel all your combos into dodge once you get an upgrade for it, so even though your combos start to feel more and more like they're getting clunkier as the enemies get harder, you never feel like it's really your fault that you get hit by anything. And you can just buy a ton of potions to cheese everything if needed.

The art is reminescent of Odin Sphere and Dragons Crown, both of which are painted beat'em'ups.

Everything else kind of pisses me off. 

The game takes a rather long amount of time to load everything, cutscenes, to my knowledge, are unskippable, the soundtrack is not great, the skill tree is kind of a pain to navigate, the prices for everything are FUCKED, and the enemy design is baffling. And I can't comment on the story, because the translation is so strange. At one point in the story, instead of typing an elipses, the character says in parenthesis that he is visibly shocked and silent, which I feel sets the mood for the quality of the entire story.

Exploration isn't very fun. You get locked into rooms a lot for set enemy encounters, because the game doesn't give you much of an incentive to grind and they have to make you fight enemies somehow. And there's always a bunch of traps inflicting annoying status effects on you, and you have to either sit still for 5 seconds mashing away your frozen or petrified status , or you have to spend 5 second going through your potion menu to grab an antidote because for some reason it doesn't show up by default on your bar.

The combat skills would be nice, but they don't feel like they have any utility or use past the first one. They don't really scale well, and the rage costs for them are crazy high.

And let me talk about the Soul Reaper, because fuck her. You first face her in the beginning of the game, and she's basically unbeatable because she just spams beserker barrage with no recovery and has permanent armor, and you probably haven't spent the mana to let you cancel your attacks into dodge, so every time you try to hit her with a combo she gets free damage on you. If you spend the half hour to beat her though, the game rewards you thoroughly with a bad ending, which is unskippable, and returns you to the title screen for another two minutes of wasted time. Seriously, what a massive middle finger. 

Then you fight her again later in the game, which I feel is a nice touch. It's a common trope in a lot of games to face a boss you couldn't beat in the beginning so you can feel like your character has progressed and become stronger and stuff. Except this time around, you realize that you haven't really become that much stronger at all, you just have an ability that lets you cancel everything into dodge.

See, the first two phases are fine,  but then you have 3 phases that are identical to the armored phase she had in the beginning of the game. So really, you just poke her while she spams beserker barrage while you wait for her to use her one move with any recovery time. Because you don't have a ranged attack to use, all you can do is attack once, then dodge, then do a dash attack, then dodge, over and over again because there is absolutely no opportunity for you to do anything else while she is spamming that move. And it takes YEARS. Then she finally switches to different moves, most of which are not nearly as frustrating to dodge, except she has practically no recovery on them, so she gets to set herself up for either another projectile move with no recovery, or you guessed it: beserker barrage. 

The best part is when you roll away from a projectile to dodge, and she's off screen, and then she uses beserker barrage to attack you, but for some reason, when she's off screen the audio cue for it doesn't play, so she just practically fucking teleports to you and claws your face off for 60% health. So really, your only option is to just be rolling towards her all the time in case she does a random beserker barrage.

And if you find you don't have enough potions, you have to back track through the entire dungeon, reach a teleport point, go to a town, and buy 12 potions or something, because all other equipment is either overpriced or useless, and then make your way back to the boss room.

And you know what, that's fine. It really is. Difficult bosses can be fun. It can be fun to fight unfair bosses, and once you beat them, you feel like they really aren't all that unfair, and that you did something nice.

But what isn't fun, is that creator, knowing this bullshit, perma-armored boss would be killing you at least 4 times, decided to put unskippable cutscenes that take 10 fucking years to sit through both before you fight the boss and after you die to the boss, so every time you die, you have to either sit through 2 DECADES of UNSKIPPABLE DRIVEL, or restart the game, and sit through 5 years of loading time and 10 years of unskippable drivel.

And that's what REALLY fucking pisses me off.

The potential is there: the art is great, the concept is nice and the story could be rewritten into something interesting.
However, at the end of the day, it falls short on so many things that the only reason i could have to actually recommend it is the low price.

The controls are responsive and you never feel like the character won't do what you want her to do, but the movement is clunky, jumping has zero mobility, and dodging is the only reliable way to reposition yourself. For a game that seems to focus on action, the fact that whenever you attack an enemy you're bound to the ground where you're standing, and the only way to work around is to dodge -thus breaking your chance deal consistent damage- feels underwhelming.

Enemies are rarely dangerous as their damage is negligible, but it's incredibly frustrating to fight because the second yo enter a room all the present enemies (including those that you can't see) commence their attack. This means you can get stunlocked right after walking into a new place, and will keep getting hit by random arrows or cannonballs until you find where the fuck that guy is. The same applies to traps: they're not dangerous, they won't kill you, they simply slow you down by making you wait for Vivian to get up for the umpteenth time.

The weapon upgrade system is a thing that exists, yet not even once have I felt the need to use it. Runes are a less common drop than equipment, including fully upgraded pieces. Also, the buying prices for anything that's not uncooked food are absolutely outrageous, making money mostly useless. So is cooking, by the way. It's easier to buy the one cooking recipe with the bonus that you need and, since it lasts forever, there's no reason to ever cook unless you're really desperate to heal yourself, in which case it's still better to just eat the ingredients raw as they're really abundant. By the way, it'd be nice to have some way to know which food buff we have active, I really have no idea if I ever actually got buffed or not because there's no indication whatsoever.

Why do bosses have a level? We can't gauge the bosses' strength by their level since Vivian doesn't have a level herself to compare to. I've fought a lvl 25 boss, then a lvl 40 boss and then a lvl 50 boss with pretty much the same equipment, and the only thing that made a difference on difficulty was their moveset, not their damage or their HP, so I don't see the point.

On the matter of bosses, their AI is stupid or non-existant. Mobile bosses can be cheesed by constantly dodging to their backs with almost zero consequences, but immobile bosses like the undead king or the statue are incredibly annoying to kill because their moveset is fully composed of attacks that make you wish you'd be away from them, and since your only way to fight is on melee, they become slow and annoying. The undead king is notoriously bad because its difficulty is directly related to how much he decides to spam certain skills instead of others, or how often he suddenly stops attacking altogether and becomes a puchingball instead.

Traversing the maps is also quite bothersome due to random locked fights that serve no purpose. Locked fights in certain games exist to introduce new enemies, to force you into fighting under certain conditions, or to make sure you are weakened before reaching a cetain place. In the Vagrant, locked fights are just random, they have no reason to exist. Most of the time you'll be stuck fighting the same wolves and rats you've already killed a few dozen times before. Sometimes locked fights will trigger again if you go through the same place before activating a specific event. Sometimes the game will lock you in a fight against a deer that doesn't even attack you, like, why am I forced to kill this random, innocent animal? What's the lesson here? What's the point? It's not hard to kill them, they don't give good loot, they're just there and you can't keep walking until you kill them. Why?

Writting is all over the place. The english translation is awkward, but even if it was proper, dialogue feels forced and bland. The cutscene when the wizard girls gets to the void is specially weird, the transitions make no sense and the action isn't properly conveyed at all, the same applies to the next cutscene with about Vivian's father. I couldn't make heads nor tails out of it.

Can the game still be enjoyed? Sure, I guess. It works, and even though there's a few bugs here and there, none of them are game-breaking (I did have to restart the game once due to the undead king sending my off-screen). The art is great, the music is kind of there and level design is not entirely bad (there's a couple of dungeons with levers/buttons and doors that give zero information on what you just did, that could be worked on) and the controls are responsive enough, so it's not a complete waste of a game. Still there's much to work and polish before it can be considered actually good.

Edit: Also, why would you make double jump a requisite to advance through certain places, and at the same time an optional upgrade that you can easily miss if you don't check every single upgrade available? That's some really, really terrible game design. Players who get to a certain point without double jump will be forced to grind for mana only to buy it and be able to advance. If it's a mandatory thing to have, then don't make it an optional ability purchase.",1530269047,1531408619

For an early access title it pulls off status improvements well, allowing you to improve the character Vivian's abilities as well as her strength and defense. while this does sound like a great game, it still needs a few improvements, as follows:

- English translation needs work
- Load times when loading a file could be shorter

This game is very well-done, with great visuals, quality audio, and a solid (if, admittedly, not flawless) localization. It also plays extremely well. There are skills to unlock and find, lots of equipment to get, weapon and armor crafting, gear upgrades through magic infusion (""enhancing"") and also magical runes (""enchanting"")... it's completely ridiculous how good this game is based on the price.

And yeah, there's a good bit of fanservice, but it's not completely over-the-top. There's nothing in here a 9 year old hasn't seen on TV or Youtube, so don't worry too much about that. 

I haven't finished the game, so I can't say anything about the length. It might be shortish. With that said, the vast quantities of ??? in the quick travel menu and in the bestiary lead me to believe that this game is actually rather long.

Honestly, even just the bit that I've played so far is WELL worth the price of admission. If you like 2D action games, pick this up. Seriously. It's fantastic!

Enjoy Vanillaware games - the obvious comparison. If you've never experienced a Vanillaware game, you may also:
Enjoy well tuned 2D action games, namely non-platformer sidescrollers (Castlevania, Dust: An Elysian Tail).
Enjoy sexual aesthetic in a political climate that has postmodernists chomping at the bit to sterilize every game they can.

Pros:
That price, holy smokes! You way more than get your money worth on this one. The music is well used but also enjoyable by itself. The backgrounds are beautiful, detailed and provide great depth without distracting the player like Vanillaware's sometimes could. The combat feels more fluid than any Vanillaware game ever did, and that includes Muramasa - the way the dodge and attack rhythm flips back and forth is immensely satisfying. There's a lot of items, decent skill tree and solid use of upgrading throughout the game.

Neutral:
The story is servicable with an okay-at-best English localization. There's some anti-aliasing on a few character sprites you don't get from Vanillaware games but it was rare and minor.

Cons:
On a technical level the actual game client isn't great. I experienced full screen/window problems on occasion although it never gave me trouble while playing the game itself - only when tabbing. I'm really stretching with this one because there genuinely isn't anything I can think of to complain about with this game.


It is bonkers how cheap a game this good is. I don't understand why they've chosen to price the game so low because I actually feel as if I've stolen something for having bought it on sale. During sales this has come down to a dollar, but I would gladly pay $15. The game is still in EA for some reason but it is feature complete and leaves nothing wanting. The publisher is a red flag to some, but they started development on the game before signing on with Sakura and I can confirm the quality of the game was never sacrificed after that point.

[Pros]
- Great soundtrack.  Just flippin' great.  I thought it was going to be mostly atmospheric but it can rock, too!
- Enjoyable battles and the controls are great.  Evading (your primary defense) rolls seamlessly into further offense, and I had a great time stringing moves together to obliterate enemies as fast as possible.
- Art is beautiful, zones are charming, sprites look fantastic.
- Game is $4.  FOUR.  DOLLARS.  I'd have paid forty.

[Cons]
- Seems (Seems!) to start a bit slow, but picks up pretty quick.
- Some particular zones have a soundtrack that is meant to sound creepy, and it does, but I don't want that man, I want more of that great atmospheric stuff or the headbanging rock!  Just a personal quibble.
- Too short!!

I have to say, it's been a pleasant surprise. Combat feels really responsive and the move unlocks will have you pulling of impressive combos in no time. Level design is pretty straight forward until you reach some dungeon areas that have more verticality. Adding to the way you play the game.

The only complaint I have, is that I wish dodging was available to you from the beginning. However, you have to unlock it like other skills. Work towards this first, as it's essential for boss encounters. 

I've run into two bugs so far. The first, I lost all audio during the first boss fight. I had to restart the game to get it back. Secondly, I've found that getting hit while airborne seems to negate gravity on your character. Because all jumps sent me careening toward the ceiling. It was also fixed by reloading.",1527163005,1527163005

The graphics are great, a good vanillaware like style. You go from simple forest towns, to desolate battle fields, to giant surreal monstrous abnormal areas. 

The attack animations are serviceable. Nothing to outrages, and most of the attacks feel grounded. 

Controls are responsive. The dodge was dependable, even in the air. Never had a problem with not getting a combo to come out. Also, play this with a gamepad. Keyboard functions aint that great.

The game is pretty well optomized. Played it on both a potato of a laptop, and a more powerul sytem and never had a problem.

The music is also serviceable. Its there, its not bad, but I wont be remembering it once im done.
 
The story is present, simple, and very blunt. The writing is okay, but they are not presenting anything complex here. Characters who show up and seem important are tossed out quickly and forgotten.

But man does this game suffer from total lack of anything that really makes it stand out, other than the art.

This game has a big problem for me: getting hit from something off screen. It is super frustrating to walk into a zone and be hit with an arrow, or be frozen from something on the other side of the zone, or load into a zone where a flame breathing statue will immediately hit you. It happens often, and its annoying. You will be saying ""What hit me? I just got here!"" 

The gameplay, while nice, never feels great. The combos are simple and short, but never really give you a sense of power. I feel like the heavy attack is under used in the gameplay. All it does is knock down enemies, and you cant attack grounded enemies, and eventually breaks enemies guard if they have a shield. You do get a dive kick eventually, and a flying kick out of a sprint, but they never really become useful, and I only used the dive kick to close the distance to enemies mid air.  The heavy attack is not all that useful once you get a combo that breaks guard. And even then, enemies stop showing up with shields quickly. It feels like they could have done more with it. 

The special skills are good, but I only found myself using 2 of them. Also, I can appreciate that you are invincible while using them, which has saved me multiple times. I just wished the game offered more. The spinning jump and the multiple thrust attack, whose names im forgetting, are the only really useful low cost attacks.

The upgrades feel useless. I felt really disappointed with the weapon enchant system, as any runes or upgrades never made me feel powerful. Any damage was barley noticable, and it felt like I was doing only slightly more damage towrds the end of the game than the middle. It never felt like I was ramping up in power,  and the game started to feel like a slog for it close to the end.

And getting gold and mana for upgrades is unbalanced. Closer to the end of the game I was getting less gold, less mana, and less drops from tougher enemies. While the beginning gave me a surprising amount of gold, I would start walking out of dungeons gaining less and less than the previous ones. I found myself getting more gold and mana by backtracking through easier areas. Its odd to feel like im getting less from harder areas. Also, everything feels expensive. 5k gold for butter, and 5 million gold for the best weapon and armor you can get. Weapons and armor drop at a nice clip early to mid game, but stop dropping usful gear closer to the end. It was difficult to even think about buying anything other than potions.

But the real difficulty in the game comes from enemies reacting to being hit. Some enemies move away after the first hit, some even continue casting while being hit, and some enemies dont even care that they are being hit and just continue attaching. The real challenge it hearding groups of them safely as the game spawns more. Is it punishingly difficult? No. Its just kinda starts to feel like a chore. It is often way more beneficial to run away to the next room when you can, ignoring rooms with enemies.

This is a game that starts high, but really felt worse the farther in I got. This review was written before they added the void, which is supposedly the final area, but I feel like ive had my fill of it.",1526756820,1526756820

The combat system is solid and fun, and I feel the only thing would bother someone is the art style, as the caracters are cartoonishly exagerated (the protagonist and most adult females I've seen have breasts bigger than their heads, which is not that strange in this medium actually), and I've seen some animations that look quite stiff, not to mention some enemies that look straight weird (like the pigs).

Side scrollerand each area feels unique. (a lot of the female characters have huge boobs though, which while enjoyable for me it did get bland.)

Sound: Appropriate for the theme of the areas. Did find myself enjoying the music multuiple times.

Story: Same old cookie cutter, family members died and you have to find out their past. The story only progresses because the main character has no choice or dies. 

Combat: More hack and slashy feel. Varied combos to not feel totally stale, but if you want combos to be repetitive it can. Nearly every enemy has well telegraphed attacks so you can proper counter them. 

Bosses: This got its own category because how displeasing they are. Boss attacks are repetitive with little variation. Early game focuses on making the bosses as tanky as possible. Later on the bosses use invincibility mechanics which further make them repetitive and time consuming. This is the sole reason I won't complete the game, terrible bosses.

Extra thoughts: RPG elements are simple enough to understand, but enough complexity to gain that extra edge when you need it. Skill tree makes things easy enough to understand, though the recommended nodes to pick are confusing at first. Love how the game encourages exploration especially early on, but feels unrewarding later.

Given the price I recommend to give it a try. Especially to those that like RPGs and side scrollers.

Combat is very engaging, with fast pace and flow that rewards skilled players that can pull some nice maneveurs such as air combos and juggles; not to mention that cancelling animations with dodges gives that Bayonetta-esque vibe that is fantastic for action games. Haven't finished the game yet, but the story so far is ok; not compelling, but interesting.

Considering the pricing, it is a fantastic fully fledged game; honestly, it should cost more. The quality of both graphics and gameplay is highly impressive.

However, here are some constructive criticism and suggestions I'd like to add to make the experience even more pleasant:

- Air speed should be increased while not running, to make some platform segments less frustrating.

- Jump and double jump should be higher to allow jumping over larger enemies easier.

- Adding anti-air for Normal and Heavy Attacks by pressing Up + Attack would greatly enhance combat and allow for more fluid combos.

- Adding aerial dives for Normal and Heavy Attacks by pressing Down + Attack while in the air would be pretty fun to; maybe the dive Heavy Attack could cause a small shockwave that hits nearby enemies.

- Allow fall-through platforms by pressing Down + Jump. This is something pretty much standard for any platformer.

- Increase the hitbox of the Dash Heavy Attack (the flying kick); it is quite hard to land even on some larger enemies.

- Different types of weapons would be really nice, such as two handed swords, axes and even spears.

- New Game Plus is a must for this game. It should be heavily considered to be added, allowing the player to restart the game in a higher difficulty with all equipment, skills and abilities learned in the previous playthrough; as well some exclusive content for this mode. New Game Plus always add a great deal of replayability for any game, and this one is no exception.

- Some UI animations look a bit rubbish, mostly for shops and menus. I also think the UIs for the menus could use some polishing. They feel a bit bland.

- Add an option to sort inventory items by name, slots, etc.

- The health and rage UI should have numbers instead of just the bars.

- Adding an indicator for the Skills while in combat would be great, so players could know how much rage they would have avaliable for specific skills.

- While I don't think this game needs a full voice acting, perhaps adding some ""grunts"" before each line of dialogue would be effective to convey emotions better, in a vein done by Legend of Zelda and Muramasa: The Demon Blade.",1524123412,1524123412

- dialogue: grammar mistakes, confusing prompts, weird spacing, flickering text
- bland storytelling: generic fantasy world with one-note characters
- repetitive combat: 90% of encounters devolve into pinning enemies against a wall
- momentum: you shouldn't come to a full stop after rolls and air dodges 
- bugs: invisible floors, projectiles failing to vanish post-collision, at least one boss glitching out and causing a temporary softlock
- quick menu: no way to remove items and avoid clutter
- unexplained mechanics (e.g. recycling runes from weapons)
- underwhelming sound effects during boss fights  
- long boot time (20-30 seconds)

Some pros:
- nice storybook aesthetic
- combat system is fleshed out with skill trees, buffs, status ailments

This game is fun to play but there are a few problems that stand in the way of this game being very fun, I'll list them.

Boss fights: Boss fights are easy (So far) All of them being faceroll (No challenge) If you're strong enough, you can outlast boss fights by dodge rolling and swinging your sword. 

How to Change: Make boss attacks punishing to avoid facerolling a boss and require the player to use tactics.

Monsters: Nothing special to say here (So far) Undead monsters, goblins(I think) and animals you find in real life.

How to Change: Browse the internet for a while using the search phrase ""Monsters for games that aren't chiche""

Terrain effects: Throughout the game you encounter items that you can break to release poison, or even turn yourself into stone. None of these work on monsters in game. Its almost like OTK Games knew this wasn't going to be a difficult game so they added random things (That you avoid after the first time you break it.) to up the challenge.

How to Change: The status effect from these items should effect monsters too.

Character Design: While this isn't an issue with gameplay I don't understand why Vivian is wearing a bikini but everyone else is wearing normal clothes. Very Anime/10 on character design.

How to Change: Don't, I dig it. I just don't understand why you guys (I'm assuming) did it this way.

Story: So far the story is about as original as a forgery.

How to Change: At this point there probably isn't any reason to try.

Controls: The controls for the most part are perfect, the default keybindings are a joke though. Jumping is the biggest headache I've had playing this game. (Once you get double jump its not as bad) I'm not sure why developers put a slide after jumping but when you're getting orgied from all sides by enemies its not welcome here.

How to Change: Get rid of the slide!!! Its stupid.

Map: The map is only helpful because without it you'd get lost. I know, I know, thats what a map is meant to do. My issue with it is that its a stationary map that you cannot interact with at all. Your ""You are here"" character icon on the map doesn't move with you. Something else thats a smaller issue that goes away after you figure it out is that the map will tell you to go down, and you'll see the prompt telling you ""This is a way to go"" but the games background will make it look like you're going up. Not a problem after a while but for newer players it can be confusing.

How to Change: Have the icon follow your hero within the box she is in. Let players slide the map around so we can see where we've explored, where we might want to go back to, etc. If the map wants you to go down, don't put an up road background in that area.

Potions: This one might just be me. Whenever you pick up a potion it will equipt it to your character for use. This means if you have a strong potion equipt and you pick up a weak potion it'll automatically replace your strong potion. This isn't alway an issue because the game isn't difficult (So far) but should the games difficulty go up it might start to pose a problem.

How to Change: Just remove this feature from the game.

Overall the game is fun to play, these are just the issues I have with it so give it a try.

As of writing this review (2/27/2018), I've cleared up to the current patch's content and I'm already hungry for more! The action is fun and rewarding, the abilities are really cool and fun to use, and the various environments and characters are pleasant to look at. The music is fitting and even awesome at times. I'm also very impressed with the mechanics and highly recommend playing on a controller, which just feels perfect. The skill tree is a bit standard with only passive effects and stat-boosters, but it works just fine for the system as a whole.

The story seems a bit convoluted at first, but begins to make more sense later on. Currently there are some missing parts, but that's because it's not even finished yet and I really want the last few puzzle pieces! The game tends to throw exposition at you in chunks from time to time, but it didn't bother me all that much. Most importantly, the main character is likeable with a touch of feels, and the progression of events is easy to follow. I did also enjoy the various interactions with NPCs in their designated ""lore zones,"" giving backstory on the area and it's characters.

If you like Dragon's Crown, or Vanillaware games in general, you have to try The Vagrant or you're just missing out on a potentially great experience. The lower budget hasn't been an issue at all.

That being said, I sat down to just ""check out"" this title last night and ended up playing non-stop until I finally died and decided to go to bed.  And really, I only went to bed because I knew if I restarted from my last save point, I would be up all night and exhausted at work today.

For the most part, the game is pretty simple.  Combat is more or less just a variety of combinations of the weak attack and strong attack buttons with a dash/evade and a skill/special attack button.  But it is very smooth.  The skill tree reminds me a little of older Final Fantasy games.  The weapon and armor enhancements are, again, relatively simple, but your choices make a noticable difference in combat.  The ""crafting"" seems to amount to just collecting random things which you can use to gain buffs at a campfire or trade for gear from a blacksmith.  It's kind of a refreshing change from the overly complicated crafting systems in so many other games, but it does feel a little strange when you hit a bee hive or pile of rocks and a block of butter pops out.  

As I said, the controls are pretty smooth.  Especially in combat.  I very much recommend following the game's suggestion to use a controller.  I use a PS4 controller and the game makes use of every button except the touch pad.  I'd have to expect it would be very tedious to play with a keyboard.  The decision to use ""up"" as the action button felt really odd at first, but I got use to it pretty quickly.  

Visually, the game is beautiful.  The backgrounds have a gorgeous, hand-painted sort of feel to them and the character and mob sprites look great.  Some of the animations are a little clunky, but it doesn't really take away from the gameplay.  Each NPC you encounter is it's own separate being without duplicate or really (as far as I've seen) similar sprites used in the game.  Mobs are less unique, as one would expect, though recolors of sprites do help add a bit of variety.  And yes, the main character has big boobs that bounce when you run, but that stopped being entertaining enough to hold my attention after about 2 minutes of playing.

So far, the story is interesting, but in my personal opinion, somewhat lacking.  There seems to be a whole lot of NPCs who just show up out of nowhere and basically tell the main character that she has no choice but to do what they want.  And, at least so far, the main character pretty much just accepts it without much arguing.  ""Huh.  The ship sank.  Oh well.""  ""You put an enchantment on me after I helped you out?  Guess I gotta be your slave for awhile now.""  It's just some pretty weak story telling with horribly simple plot devices.  It IS still interesting, and the little bit of backstory and foreshadowing I've experienced suggests that the characters' motivations will be brought to light as the story progresses.  But just keep in mind that, in the beginning at least, the story is no Tale of Two Cities.  The cut scenes are provided by text over ""painted"" stills, but it really fits the style of the game and so far have been really nice.

Over-all, the game is just fun to play, and really, that's what matters.  The style and theme remind me a bit of Golden Axe but with better graphics and a storyline.  My opinions may completely change once I'm farther into the game, and of course, it IS an Early Access title, so they may find ways to screw it up.

[spoiler]
I am generally not pleased when a game blames you for something you did not do.  Thgis is a personal thing but it's also sort of a ""trigger.""  Take that as you like.  
I tend to be very annoyed when you get blamed for something your character has done 2 chapters into the game that you were not made aware of.  I tend to be extremely annoyed when the somewhat detailed background given for the character does not mention this thing you are being punished for.  Especially if it is something important like a character class.  
I tend to be supremely annoyed when such punishment would be easily avoidably by people just not being complete (smurf)holes.  
Most people don't play games to be punished.  No matter how cool that seems like it might be when writing the plot.  And I can tell where this is probably going.  Said (smurf)hole will be forgiven in the end and everyone will learn to get along or something like that.  Maybe she turns out to be a defeatable bad guy I've seen this plot before and I'm very likely to bail here.  No thanks.  I don't need it.
I am annoyed enough with that one thing that I am sereiously considering asking for a refund.  I probably won't.  But I'm considering it.
[/spoiler]
Theoretically, if I did that right then the above few paragraphs are blacked out till you scroll over them.  
So, assuming what is in the ""spoiler"" zone doesn't bother you Vagrant is not a bad game.  I don't recommend paying full price for it, but I rarely do.    It is a solid if basic side scroll fighting game.  It could use some verticality.  Looks like various weapons and armors.  Has some crafting for food stuffs and such.  Can add magics to weapons.  The combat sections themselves are okay.  Not great but moderately good.  The way the side paths work is kind of confusing.  I'm sure the devs could see it in their heads but I think a mini map function might be in order for this.  The art work is extremely good.
Do I recommend this.  To be honest the plot thing has really (smurf)ed me off.  If it weren’t for that I would give it a thumbs-up without question.  Perhaps not an enthusiastic one.  But a positive none the less.  AS it is, no.  On a personal level I'm far too angry with this <see spoilers> business.  And that may well be me personally.

Dragons Crown makes a lot of the more boring aspects of the game entertaining by creating minigames out of events like camping and cooking. 

The biggest drawback is that your character's appearance doesn't change when equipping anything but a new weapon and that save points are spread out fairly far apart from one another. Since story events occur at campouts having a save system that could be accessed from the menu would be preferable since this is about the story and less about grinding out gear like in Dragons Crown. 

I enjoy side scrolling action games like this but mostly because of the co-op aspect. This game is fun, but as a single player game it feels pretty empty. Music only happens on boss fights and the rest of game is just ambient weather/environmental noise which is one of the main reasons why it feels empty. It could benefit from multi-player and if a sequel is in the works please add co-op!

The fighting is engaging and combo's string together nicely. The skill node tree is good, but lacks any real depth. Equipment management and upgrades use the same points that you spend on your ability tree which makes upgrading your equipment risk vs. reward and I found myself struggling to deal with low power weapons and armor in favor of having more health and rage so I wouldn't die as easily...but then suffering because fights would take forever.

Overall a decent game, just not my cup of tea. If you are more into the single-player aspect of games like Dragons Crown and Odins Sphere then this game is for you. If you're like me and enjoy those kinds of games for their multi-player aspects then this game might not be for you.",1517985522,1517985522

A good action RPG side-scrolling with good plot, good ability system

Some of side quest which benefit player need to be implement, because

You owe it to yourself to try this game. It's far from perfect, can be really rough around the edges, but the core of the game is extremely solid.

Pros:
Great gameplay.
Good combat. Feels extremely tight.
Controls are perfect. Executing combos takes some skill and timing, but feels amazing when you do.
Visuals are amazing.

Cons:
The menus and UI need a bit of work (I still can't figure out a way to see your buffs and debuffs, particularly food buffs).
Some enemy design is... infuriating, and not in a good way. XD
The story is paced very oddly, and not written particularly well.
Sometimes they gate access to maps not by abilities or keys but by literally popping up something saying you can't go there.
Double tap to run. D: I know this isn't bad, but outside of combat there's not a lot of times I'd rather walk than run.

Seriously, it's 4 fucking dollars. I don't know why it's this cheap. Buy it and play it. It's cheaper than a matinee and you'll easily get a number of hours out of it.",1516007123,1516007123

But.

I must say I really enjoyed playing this.

Pros:
- Beautiful art. I see reviews that this game is being compared to Odin's Sphere or Dragon's Crown which I am not very familiar with. The scenery moves which breathes life into the theme of the area. Also the animation is pretty good.

- There's a skill tree system which has a lot of potential. Hopefully the expand this as the game develops.

- Challenging to some extent. I like the variety of enemies and their behaviours. No one way to defeat them. I also like the idea of 'Rifts'.

- If you played Castlevania, the level of backtracking here will be familiar. I don't know about you but to visit areas you've previously explored to grind loot/experience/items hits the spot. There are also some traps and rooms with hidden passages which is pretty neat.

- NPC reactions vary whether Vivan decides to do transactions or just browse with merchants. It's pretty small but I like how they give personalities to the characters.

- Weapon varieties are also a YES!

- Tiddies

Cons:

- Some fights get a bit repetitive. I did mention it posed some challenge to the player but often you have a specific combo to deal with most enemies.

- Music variety. It has good BGMs but a bit overshadowed in my opinion.

- Some more movesets would be nice too.

Overall, I love where this game is going. I'm eager to see where the game will go. Please do note that this game is still in Early Access and I just hit a blocked area in-game stating to stay tuned for the updates. I do recommend this game for people who haven't played games like Castlevania. I can't judge the plot yet since it's not done but I'm eager to find out where Vivian will go.

9/10.

O.T.K Games' The Warden is a no-brainer at US$2.39 even though its in early access, as it has gameplay very close to that of Vanillaware's games, beautiful artstyle, decent soundtrack and fairly snappy combat with fun mechanics.

You play as Vivian, a Runewarden, who is looking into the disappearance of her father, who apparently was in possesion of a mysterious book which lead him to leave his family behind; naturally you encounter all sorts of evil while doing so. Earned Mana/XP can be spent on either upgrading your weapons and armor or on character development and abilities such as Double Jump, a few new combos, increased Attack, Defense, HP or Crit.

Aside from a few issues it's really fun, easy to pick up, and keeps me coming back for more. If you like beat'em ups, light platformers, or 2D gaming then I highly recommend The Vagrant.

Pros:

Beautifully drawn 2D graphics
Tight controlls
Fun combat with a bit of depth
Skill system easy to understand
Varied NPCS and some with a few secrets/rewards
Good Story
Replay value (can keep challenging special areas and you have to farm currancy to access special areas)
Music is decent

Cons: 

Translation issues - while not that bad, they are noticable
The menu is a bit clunky
Small dev. team/slowish updates
Balance issues - Healing potions and food items are used to regain HP/Rage meter. Food items can be abused by going to the menu and pausing the action and refilling HP/Rage too easily

I have to spit non-spoiled review into English and Thai language (Covered final version - Chapter 6)
การรีวิวไม่สปอยล์นี้แบ่งออกเป็นสองภาษา (อังกฤษ – ไทย)

[h1]---------------[English] ---------------[/h1]

The Vagrant introduces Vivian’s journey in Mystery Island named Mythrilia. This 2016 kickstarter project is heavily inspired from Dragon's Crown, Oboro Muramasa, and Castlevania X in term of gameplay and art direction. 

The world filled by hand-drawing characters and charming environment. The variation of music is noticeable from acoustic to heavy metal. It’s very subjective taste but I found it fits very well.

The Vagrant offers simple mechanics (2D combat, exploration, character progression). The world is divided into many sub sections filled by different threats and themes. In combat, the game offers basic two-button sword action which can be expended by movement input and player position. Player can also use special skills which consume amount of rage gauge to unleash powerful attack. Each skills and combo are well designed and worth by purpose. Combined with responsive control and feedback, it creates fluid and solid action. Moreover, the boss fight design can be inconsistent in difficulty, but they’re fair challenge and fun once you figure out their patterns.

The exploration in Mythrilia offers fair rewards such as key item to learn new moves and new rage skills. Blending objects into environment keep enticing player to discover and learn world design.  All enemies and breakable object can drop gold and mana. Mana is mainly used to unlock skills and enhance gears. There are also small feature like enchant rune system that allow you to customize extra attribute for items and campfire cooking that give permanent bonus depends on choose receipt which are nice touch.

However, the game still need some improvement and tweaks during early access state. These include translation and UI accessibility for player. There’s also huge gap between some items and abilities, require huge grind which I feel like it keeps slow down on progression. Infinite spawn in some area can sometimes get frustrating in exploration. Finally, the rift area (unlock after defeat boss in each area) doesn’t offer worth payoff compared on cost you pay for rift access.

The Vagrant finally released 6th chapter with satisfied final act and challenge elements. Although it has major changes of design based on original project. But it’s very solid 2D action title with some interesting features that have potential. I believe that amount of feedback and right direction from developers with help to polish this gem to its best.

The Vagrant นำเสนอเรื่องราวของการผจัญภัยของวิเวียนในดินแดนแห่ง Mythrilia ภายใต้โปรเจค Kickstater ปี 2016 ที่ได้รับแรงบันดาลใจจากเกม Dragon's Crown, Oboro Muramasa, และ Castlevania X ในมุมมองของระบบการเล่นและทิศทางงานศิลป์

ดินแดนและตัวละครใน Mythrilia ถูกรังสรรค์ด้วยงานวาดมืออันน่าหลงไหล มีเสน่ห์ พร้อมด้วยเพลงประกอบอันหลากหลายตั้งแต่เพลงสไตล์อะคูสติกไปจนถึงจังหวะเฮฟวีเมทัลชวนระทึก เป็นที่น่าจดจำสำหรับบางคน

The Vagrant ดำเนินเกมภายใต้สูตรอันเรียบง่าย (ระบบต่อสู้สองมิติ, การสำรวจ, และการพัฒนาตัวละคร) แต่ละแผนที่จะประกอบไปด้วยพื้นที่เล็กๆ เชื่อมต่อกัน แต่แยกด้วยธีมและภัยอันตรายต่างชนิด ระบบการต่อสู้อาวุธดาบที่ประกอบไปด้วยการกดปุ่มแอคชั่นสองแบบ แต่สามารถสร้างคอมโบด้วยการกดทิศทางและตำแหน่งของวิเวียน พร้อมด้วยสกิลทรงพลังที่ใช้เกจเฉพาะอย่าง Rage แต่ล่ะสกิลและความสามารถออกแบบมาอย่างดีและมีประโยชน์ในทุกๆ สถาณการณ์ ร่วมกับการควบคุมที่ตอบสนองฉับไว แม่นยำ มันสร้างระบบแอคชั่นที่ลื่นไหลและหยิบยื่นความสนุกให้กับผู้เล่นทุกแนวได้ไม่ยาก แม้ว่าการออกแบบบอสจะมีความยากขึ้นลงในรูปแบบการโจมตีและความเสียหาย แต่โดยรวมเป็นความท้าทายที่สมเหตุสมผลและเรียกร้องการเรียนรู้ในระดับหนึ่ง

การสำรวจในดินแดน Mythrilia ให้ผลตอบแทนด้านไอเท็มสำหรับปลดล็อคสกิลและความสามารถใหม่ การออกแบบของงานศิลป์ที่กลืนวัตถุเข้ากับสภาพแวดล้อม เรียกร้องให้ผู้เล่นเข้าไปมีส่วนรวมและค้นหาด้วยตัวเอง เหล่ามอนสเตอร์และวัตถุที่ให้ Gold และ Mana ปัจจัยหลักในการพัฒนาความสามารถและอัพเกรดอุปกรณ์ของวิเวียน นอกจากนั้นยังมีระบบย่อยเช่น การปรับแต่งอุปกรณ์ด้วย Enchant Rune และการปรุงอาหารที่แคมป์ไฟเพื่อเลือกรับโบนัสถาวรตามชนิดของอาหารนั้นๆ

อย่างไรก็ตาม เนื่องจากตัวเกมอยู่ในขั้น Early Access ตัวเกมยังคงต้องได้รับการขัดเกลาในหลายจุด การแปลภาษา บทสนทนา และเมนูผู้ใช้งานที่ยังขาดความสะดวกสะบายเท่าที่ควร ไอเท็มบางชนิดที่ตั้งราคาสูงลิ่วจนเหมือนถูกบังคับให้ฟาร์มเม็ดเงินซ้ำแล้วซ้ำเล่า ไอเท็มชนิดเดียวกันแต่ถูกจำหน่ายต่างราคาจาก NPC บางจุดของเกมที่เรียกศัตรูออกมาไม่มีวันหมดจนสร้างความหงุดหงิดในการสำรวจ และสุดท้ายเขต Rift (พื้นที่พิเศษที่ปลดล็อคหลังปราบบอสแต่ล่ะพื้นที่) กลับไม่ได้ให้ผลรางวัลตอบแทนคุ้มค่าเท่าที่ Gold ที่เสียไป

The Vagrant ได้อัพเดตบทที่ 6 ซึ่งเป็นบทสุดท้ายของการเดินทางที่มอบความท้าทายและบทสรุปอันพึงพอใจในการเดินทางของ Vivian โดยแม้ว่าจะมีการเปลี่ยนแปลงการออกแบบในหลายๆ จุดเมื่อเทียบกับทิศทางดั่งเดิมของโปรเจคที่โฆษณาไว้ แต่ก็ยังมอบประสบการณ์การเล่นที่กระชับ เข้มข้น และเพลิดเพลินภายใต้ระบบต่างๆ ที่ดูเรียบง่ายในภายนอก หากถูกขัดเกลาจากการตอบรับของผู้เล่นและคงทิศทางของการพัฒนาไว้ The Vagrant จะไม่ต่างอะไรผลงานเกมชิ้นเลิศที่มีคุณค่าและความสนุกในตัวมันเอง",1511082577,1528189234

One thing to note is that you are only using a sword, it just can come in different elements and atk power.

The star char upgrade system is decent enough and works well so your character does get stronger as you go through the game not just from gear but from your picked upgrades (ranging from just hp ups to new moves)

Can’t wait for the game to be completed, what’s available now is solid and worthwhile. Takes me back to wanting to start a game of legend of mana

Story is ok i guess. For me personally anything to explain why you must play the game is fine, can have none ate all.
Games like this is just great because of all the action, ombos, satges, boss, euip, stats items, etc.

Pros:
+ Nice and simple combos
+ Dificult is on mobs types and the way game mix them together.
+ Beautiful art
+ Metroidvania
+ Meant to be played with a controller
+ Nice skills effects and effectiveness
+ Movementation feels right
+ Good response

Cons:
- No acting voices for dialogues
- Game doesn't explain every details of the game so clearly

It doesn't even matter since they're not increasing the price so, technially you're going to get full game regardless. Read the ""Early Access Game"" description.

If you like hack and slash 2D games. I would recommend this game for sure. The environment isn't bland and not just some background. Rough around the edges but still nice. Character build up isn't quite there but leans towards a good direction if polished (it's rushed). One of the things i like about this game is the elemental weapons changing the properties of effects on attacks especially skills. For example, the regular version of the first skill projects an X shape wave attack. Using lightning projects surges of electricity in a line of fire. Ice shoots a spinning glacial blade also in a straight line. Fire shoots out three fireball projectiles. fyi, they don't do the same dmg as each other.

Overall, good game but not just complete. Whether or not you show the devs some love. You will still get full game for the same price when it's released.

While just getting into the game you start with no combo's, outside of spamming your light attack and it takes a little bit of time before you earn mana to unlock all your light > heavy combos  Then the combat start to feel good-ish, if a bit 2 dimensional. 

The translations are very wonky at the moment as well, but understandable. - While killing boars you'll find ""meet chunks"". - Most of the things aren't that bad but since the game has quite a focus on story through text, visual novel style, it's obviously a bit ""ehhhhhhh"".

I played my very first game with the Rivers expansion activated.  Starting a game with rivers, you first play all the river tiles to make a complete river, until all river tiles are used up.  There is literally only one place to play a river tile, and only two orientations based on either end of the river.

Several river tiles were out, and it was the AI's turn.  I sat waiting while the AI ""thought"" for literally 5 minutes about which direction to orient its river tile in the one single place it could play.  The river does not require careful calculation to set up... 5 minutes is WAY too long for an AI move at so early and simple a point in the game.  That does not bode well for the AI in general.

Took me several rounds to figure out the tricks and scoring. It gets intense when you unlock expansions and score on large lands. Pros: Its a little better than Catan as in fewer bugs and does not freeze during play. The layout is very challenging and frustrating but you always keep coming back to it. If you are a real board game nerd then this is for you. Medieval theme, totally classic, stays cool. Expansion packs? Heck Ya! If its got expansion packs then its going to be good. Cons: Like Catan, I am pretty sure the computer cheats. Ya computer is more intelligent than me but how does it that it gets a winning streak and receives the perfect tile for every scoring moment? Either that I just stink at the game. Server tends to shut down especially when you are about to win. Seems a little odd? Happens every so often. When it ungratefully shuts down you lose karma. That is the dumbest thing ever. You can not play with other players who have a higher karma than you. Server also LOGS YOU OUT automatically if it detects your account on another device and it automatically logs you in while you are already playing. Very much game rage. Its best to shut the wi-fi off on your secondary device to prevent that. There is a timer not for each players turn but for the whole game so you better crunch down on time.

As an adaption of an uncomplicated board game, I shouldn't think this would be too hard to replicate. From a game mechanism standpoint it succeeds. The trouble I have with this rendition is that I find it impossible not to compare it to the venerable TheCodingMonkeys version for iOS that I have played for years.
The art direction of Tile & Tactics appears to slightly resemble the new art from Z-Man Games physical copy and something original. The problem that I have with this is that the art is overly complicated. The board is too busy instead of the simple--easy to see at a glance--artwork from other renditions. This is further complicated by the really bad choice of meeple colors that either get lost in the tile artwork (Yellow) or too closely resemble another color (Purple/Blue).
I like the feature that allows you to see who controls the fields, but again, that's another graphic distraction.
There is another in-play button that changes the board from 3D view to 2D (my preference), but the icon is a movie camera that made me associate it with streaming or some other function making me ignore it's purpose for the first few plays.
I have not purchased any expansions yet, as I can only imagine just how much more distracting the board would become.
Carcassonne ""The Official Version"" is a clean, simple game that is hindered by the graphic design choices.
So why do I recommend it then? Convenience mostly and it does what it's supposed to. It is still an enjoyable experience, I just need to accept that it is not the digital version I'm used to playing.

The abandoned game is saved, so nothing is lost except your patience. It seems like something that they'll patch up, or should, very soon. I hope. I'm definitely not going to play it again until they do.

Besides that pretty serious bug, the game is easy to play once you learn the rules. The graphics are fine with two views of the board to choose from: flat or oblique. Play pvp by passing the mouse or over the intertubes. The relaxing classical guitar is nice, but gets tedious if you play for a while. You can turn off the music.

Look at the thread on this on Steam. Only ONE SINGLE player managed to get a response from them after obsessively emailing EVERY Asmodee email he could find. All they said is that they are very sorry, but nothing was actively being done. That was a year ago. 

WARNING:

AVOID!!

Got dropped 8 times in a single match!

Half the players get kicked off.

Your opponent can tactically choose a very short match timer, compared to average game lenght and if you do not realize that at the start and play your turns fast - you will run out of time and lose the game. Even if there's only 1 tile left in the game, and your timer runs out you still lose. Even if you place the tile, and your timer runs out before the points from said tile are granted - you lose.

Or you might get an AFK opponent, mostly people who start games and do something else - in hopes the enemy doesn't want to wait 15-30 minutes. You either wait for the match duration or you forfeit the game - giving the AFKer a free win.

There's ranking and karma, but no system for reporting AFK players and the timer thing is just retarded. After you are forced to forfeit games you are winning just because you took 10 seconds too long to place your tiles during a 100+ tile game, you just basically want to hit your head through a wall.

I always was curious about the board game version and I LOVE that I can finally learn this game in the privacy of my own pandemic-free home. The UI is a fantastic enhancement to the board game experience, showing you what is valid, which tiles that remain, even some less obvious point values accrued. I picked it up on sale, as I often do with Asmodee pen-n-paper-ported games because they just get it, how to create an immersive experience that keeps you coming back for more. I usually play solo in between work calls and I find that it is a welcome break from competitive card games that send you either into a deep FML-style depression or fits of exaltation of genius-level brilliance. This game is just for chillaxing.

The solo version, has a variety of programmed AIs, all well programmed to beat you handily for a time, then allow you to switch when you can start better predicting tile plays and placements. Personally, the AI feels balanced, but if it lucks out with a tempo-launching first turn, you will have a hard time catching up. There are also a lot of game and settings options which will improve the learning curve or ramp difficulty harder.

Why?

Because I suck at Carcassonne and want to DOMINATE the next time I visit my sister.  What more reason could you possibly need?

So if you've never played Carcassonne before, the game involves placing tiles according to limited placement rules on the board to connect them and place your men for controlling roads, lands, cities and other items.  As you take turns placing tiles, the roads, fields, and cities grow in size, and any men who control those roads, fields and cities will acquire more points for you.

Because of the placement rules, sometimes you'll have no choice but to place a tile to your opponent's advantage.  For example, you might have no other location to place a road, and your opponent already has a man controlling that road, so you just added points to their final score.

Also you only have a limited number of men to place, and sometimes the best strategy is to place in such a way to regain your men and add their score in as short a number of turns as possible. 

In the computer version the AI heartlessly crushes me time and again.  So there is the humiliation of being massively beaten at what appears to be a children's game.  It's not!  The innocent artwork hides a deep strategy game to have you begging to find a strategy guide, when you should have looked for that in the first place.  Okay me.  Yes... but I was so confident I didn't need to read one.  Well now I know.

Even if you do find a strategy guide, this will provide ample practice for the next family gathering - but hey - try not to get carried away okay?  With family try to make sure everyone is having a good time.  That's the most important thing.  This AI won't teach you that, so beware - you might just get too good at the game, and then nobody will want to play with you anymore!

Because this is a classic board game I highly recommend this.",1593572480,1602555870

Since buying this game I have been disconnected from the Asmodee game server twice. After the first disconnection I contacted them through their support contact form online - but they never responded (expect for the auto-reply). I waited a week tried a second contact, still no response from their support. 

So I deleted my Carcassonne account and re-registerd with a different username & password, then for a couple of weeks it worked okay, I could go online from within the game and play with others, update my rank and pick an avatar, then all of a sudden for no apparent reason I was disconnected once again. I can get to my Carcassonne account from my browser but not from in the game which means I can only play offline. I have tried  resetting my password and my username  but that doesn't help it keeps telling me the username and password do not match.

So 3 times more I contacted them but still no response. I searched the internet and found a customer service email address for one of their divisions, but all they did was give me a link to the support form that has never responded.  They are not interested in servicing their customers.

January 2021 - I am updating my review to say that Asmodee has started to respond to my requests for help.

Let's begin with what's good: the game allows people to play an approximation of Carcassonne over the internet and takes care of hassles like scoring and tile shuffling and so on.
Moving on to what's not. Well, everything else. EVERYTHING. These guys snatch defeat from the jaws of victory so often and so hard that to catalog it all, we'd be here all day.
First of all, it downloads and launches through Steam, but doesn't use any of Steam's other features like voice chat, chat in general, invites, etc. You have to register with Asmodee's dodgy trash fire of a network, find your friends through the network, friend them again, and THEN you can invite them to a game or accept an invite from them. There's a chat feature, but none of us trusted it enough, so be prepared to use Zoom or Steam or Discord to find each other.
After that, it might decide it doesn't feel like running on your system anymore and just stop working - the symptom is that it complains about being unable to initialize DIrect3D each time you try to run it, and the fix is to give up and install it on a different machine.
Once you actually get into the game, the bad design choices are endless. 

You don't pick your color before the game; you select your favorite color, and the game ignores this suggestion. 
About 75% of the buttons have a mysterious icon and no tool tip, so you have no idea what they do until you push them.

Everyone can see what tile the active player has been given, but only the active player can see where they are trying to put the tile - my entire play group has always enjoyed discussing the proper place to put a tile, and this lack of shared information makes that extremely difficult to do.

Meeple placement is clunky and unintuitive - on several occasions, I have seen players lock in their choice, only to discover they have not actually placed a meeple on that tile. This gets especially bad with extra meeples like the fairy.

Optimization is non-existent; this game about simple tile art and basic wooden shapes gobbles up resources like nobody's business, and it takes so long to load up or to start or join a game that you can practically go make yourself a sandwich while you wait.

The simple, elegant art of the original game is entirely ignored in favor of overly busy tiles that are hard to identify - the difference between a monastery and a random decorative hut, for example, is very small. Tile parsing is made even more difficult because cities strongly resemble patches of dirt - they only develop walls and interior structures once completed (i.e. once nobody really needs to identify them or examine them anymore). Every tile is choked with tiny details that mean nothing, and the overall effect is a visual mess.

Nor do the visual problems stop there - meeple placement is occasionally ambiguous (in our most recent game, a farmer lay across two tiles, so we had no idea which tile he was on, which was important for determining dragon attacks). Tiles may glow for a variety of reasons, which is distracting. Meeples dance at irregular intervals to make them easier to find - you can turn this distracting animation off, but then they become hard to find. The meeples don't obey the laws of perspective, so they appear to be lying or standing at different angles on what is ostensibly a flat surface. Finally, the screen real estate is clogged with menus and scoreboards that don't need to be present 100% of the time (if at all), so the map is often obscured - you can try zoom and pan, but the pan controls feel greasy (like the map will keep sliding after you stop telling it to pan), the zoom doesn't zoom out far enough for large maps, and the game delights in zooming and panning to irrelevant areas of the board without warning.

The window itself is a mess - if you choose full screen, the game will vanish the second it loses focus, even if the new window you clicked was on an entirely different monitor. If you choose Windowed mode, the window size is frozen at whatever you chose; if you don't like it, you get to restart the game.

Like I said, I could go on forever, but I'll finish with a particular gem of user unfriendliness. Remember how this ""game"" doesn't use Steam for anything except launch and download? Well, if you close Steam after joining a game (or if Steam crashes), the game shuts off, even though it has its own process and isn't using Steam for anything. Nor does the fun stop there - Carcassonne somehow interferes with running Steam on multiple computers - if you try to launch a different Steam game on a second PC, you will be logged out of Steam on the Carcassonne machine, which will kill your Carcassonne game. If you try to log back in on the Carcassonne machine, you will be logged out on the second computer. Let me remind you that Carcassonne doesn't USE ANY of Steam's features, so there's NO REASON for it to do this - it just does.

Do yourself a favor - if you like Carcassonne, buy the real game and play it over Zoom with a camera aimed at the board. You can similate the experience of owning this pile of trash by looking at the real game while occasionally slamming your hand in a drawer, except it will probably hurt less.

8th June 20 - Update
I have persevered with this game. I have found that after minimising the things starting up (skype, one note etc) then that minimises the network issues. I've also found whilst playing do not do anything else that involves network access from the PC you're using.

People who have less than 5mbit internet connections are regularly disconnected from the server.

Even with good internet connections we've had games where we've all been disconnected so definitely a problem at their end and not 5 people's internet at different locations! Also, no way for a player to be removed from the game even when they're disconnected so everyone else has to wait for that player's timer to run down before (oddly) their turns are replaced by an AI opponent.

The multiplayer can be a little sketchy at times, but it works well overall. There seems to be a big enough player base to always find a random match.

My only complaint would be the lack of many expansion packs, although it would possibly be too hard to find other players that wish to play with the exact combination of packs that you have... (this is sometimes an issue even with one expansion added.) The inclusion of 1st and 2nd edition rule-sets would have been nice too.

There is a feature that allows you to see the farm land dominance at the click of a button. This is a very important feature, as it can be hard to see where Meeples are placed on a digital representation of a playspace. An awesome addition.

Currently there are only two options for views: the default diagonal 'table' view, and a top-down straight view. I find things tend to get lost on the default setting and find the top down view to be better when playing a serious game.

Finally I would like to praise the inclusion of the adjustable (and optional) 'Chess' clock in the game. Carcassonne tends to drag on due to the numerous possible moves in the end-game, but this addition pushes things along at a nice pace.

These are all pretty minor or can be worked around:
-- The AI cheats! I'm sure of it. No way would it randomly get so many good pieces in a row. :P
-- The AI seems a little inconsistent. One game, it will make poor choices, and in the next it will bury you in an avalanche.
-- Randomly crashes to desktop on me, usually when I look at the available/remaining pieces. Fortunately the game is saved as you go, so you can just resume the current game on restart.
-- The horn blasts are too freaking loud at the start and end of the game!
-- The single musical theme constantly playing at you can get a little maddening. I turned it almost off.

So, this is a fun game: not overly complex, but with enough complexity to make game play interesting. This is especially true the more add-ons you enable in your matches.

EDIT: Added some more notes after playing this for a while.

> I found out how to change the AI level, no thanks AT ALL to any of the non-existent instructions anywhere, including the developer's web site.

> Wow the UI elements are freaking huge. I saw a post from December 2017 in which the developer stated that ""we'll think about"" changing this. So yeah, that'll happen. /s

> Seeing constant ""server disconnect"" etc in this time of Stay At Home because Plague.

> I've already logged into the game itself, from Steam, many times. Why can't the game simply remember me? Oh yeah, another development feature.

> The ""How to"" instructions are bare minimum, and poorly written.

> When quitting the game, it doesn't close. Clearly it's trying forever to perform some kind of communication, because when I shut off the network connection it closes more quickly.

> And finally for now, There are ZERO instructions for controlling the dragon. It just sits there, non-responsive to my commands no matter what key I press. This is very frustrating.",1585675562,1585810168

[b] Intro [/b]
[list]
My friend cinkolic (Nikola) from high school got super addicted to this game when I showed him in the board game club in our city. Since then, we have been playing this game for two weeks straight while on Discord. Funny thing is I had this game in my library and never bothered to run it.
[/list]
[b] Positive [/b]
[list]
The game is a great representation of the board game. The graphics are nice, not much to say about that one. I would like to see maybe some people walking around in the completed cities and roads. That would be fun. If you are familiar with board game, you will like this version. Another good thing is when you buy a game, you need to create an account of there website. This enables you to play with your friends who might have bought this game on Android or iOS.
[/list]
[b] Negative [/b]
[list]
As you saw in the comments, there are sometimes problems with losing connection. But for the most part. I would say it's stable for 95% of the time. Even if you get kicked out of the room where you are playing, you have brief period of one minute to click 'join the room' from which you have been kicked out due to connection problems. So those comments you see that are negative, because of this connection problem, are not justified really. However, putting aside the good option of being able to play with friends on other platforms, I actually did not like that I had to log in to the 3rd party website in order to create account and play online. However, it went quick and fine. I would like to see an option of being able to see profile information of players during the match. The lobby also needs improvement. It is too simple and does not provide you with many useful information while you wait for the match.
[/list]
[b] Verdict [/b]
[list]
Overall, if you like the board game you will like the digital version. Buy it if that is the case. In other case, I would first try out the board game or an online simple version and then go for this one if you find that you like the game. However, there are many things to be done for improving the whole game. Developers I hope you see this.

This Carcassonne is a faithful mobile translation of a classic board game that has been ported to windows.  It has achievements and uses user profiles for matchmaking... just not Steam achievements and user profiles.  It also retains mobile like upselling of it's DLCs in-game.

A game of Carcassonne is relatively quick at about 15 minutes long, which is good because with such a high degree of randomness it's impossible to tell the better player from a single game.

Fun game, not worth the price of entry, as your price tag easily doubles (microtransactions) to keep the game interesting after a few hours of play.

Incredibly fun little game. I logged dozens of hours on the Xbox 360 live arcade version back when it first released, and I plan on playing more. However, I just can't bring myself to recommend it. Everything interesting beyond an hour of gameplay is locked behind a microtransaction paywall, and each mechanic/aesthetic is locked individually. I'd actually invest money in the game if the price of entry wasn't $10. There isn't enough base game content to justify that, at least not in this modern marketplace. I would've just as easily purchased the game if there was a $25 price tag with all content unlocked. 

On the bright side, each mechanic you *do* purchase adds to both the complexity and the aesthetic of the game, making it much more fun in the long run.

So after playing for forever on BSW, I finally decided to pick up the official game presuming that, it being official and all, it would probably be a better implementation of the game.
Alas, compared to BSW, that has the added benefit of accessing countless games from one client, the official implementation is rather shameful.  
  

Things that BSW does that the offical implementation doesn't:  
  
Allow you to zoom out to see the entire map.  - The best the official game does is offer an isometric view, which is inferior at the start of the game, but becomes necessary as the field starts to fill up, requiring you to re-orient, which is a bit annoying. The isometric view doesn't provide full view of the board when you're playing with as few as one expansion.  
  
Allow you to see which player has what kind of meeple available at a glance - The official game only provides the total amount of meeples, unspecified, in the HUD. It requires you to click on the player names to see the specified meeples.  
  
Allow you to see the score for things like Goods at a glance - Once again the official game requires you to click through the UI  
  
Score points immediately on placing a tile without delay - The official game removes the meeples one by one with a little visual effect. It can slow the game down and doesn't really feel necessary
  
Shorter waiting times for games  
  
No disconnects ever

Plain visuals - The official game has a kind of 3D art for the tiles, which sounds nice on paper, but it makes the tiles a lot less obvious. Sometimes you have to peer for a bit to see if there's a road connected to a city or not.  
  
  
  
The things that the official game offer over the BSW implementation are definitely not trivial, but to me, less integral to the overall game experience:  
  
- A chess clock. Which is a pretty good incentive to keep the pace up.  
  
- A rating system. It's nice to see how well you're doing and if there were more players you could use it to find better quality games  
  
- Optional features to see remaining tiles, unfillable gaps on the field, and a visual for what player controls what field. 

- Achievements.


If you're looking for a nice board game to play and would feel better playing the official licensed implementation, I would still recommend this game. Carcassonne is fun as hell and the game succeeds at making it playable online. It's far from perfect though and there are alternatives that I won't advertise beyond what I've already done.",1570062656,1570062656

This is easily one of my top 5 strategy board games that I own, so naturally I was really happy when the Steam version came out. However, in all of the games that I have attempted, I have only been able to complete a few games due to how spotty this games servers are. Be prepared to get kicked out of online games a lot.

However, from what I've noticed at least, this only seems to be an issue depending on what anti-virus software you use on your computer. I used AVG when I installed this game, and I hated AVG because the anti-virus software was constantly giving me problems with games that I don't have issues with. Ever since getting rid of AVG, I haven't had any issues playing games online through Steam. Yes, there's still the occasional hiccup here and there where some players may get kicked out of the game for whatever reason, and the servers does have the tendency to be spotty in certain situations, but for the most part, I haven't had any major issues with this games online play.

The biggest issue is the lack of a proper AI design.   If you take on a single AI opponent, it'll be tough, but winnable.  Play against more than one however, and you've just handed the AI twice as many pieces with which to defeat you.  This is because the AI only seems to recognize AI and Player as options.   I have watched AI colors ignore placement options that would disrupt the other AI color in favor of disrupting me.   I have watched the AI kill it's own ability to gain 45 points from one area in order to prevent me from completing something worth 10 points, or worse, to allow i the second AI color to gain 25.   I've watched it complete the other color's cities to no value to it's own color, simply to make sure it wins.  Or more precisely, to ensure the player loses.

This sort of bad coding methods to ""increase difficulty"" kill the very play balance of the game you're attempting to recreate and make me have very little faith in the developer's ability to accurately transfer any of it's other board game properties to Steam.

The medieval music and fanfare is a cute addition that helps create an atmosphere. I also like the fact the games arent that long, limited by the number of tiles. So I can play a quick round, or a few rounds, depending on how much free time I have in the evening.

Cons: A small 'con', but I'd like a bit more in the way of help until I remember how many points different things score and can make better choices with placing my 'meeple'. Right now I'm not sure if I'm better off completing a short road, or extending a field that cant be completed. The AI has a better grasp of this, I'm sure!

1.  This is a game about seeing the board.  Giant interface buttons need to be scalable or scaled down and moved to the edges of the screen.
2. Show farms button should remain on when clicked, everytime you change games it turns off.
3. Please remove the horn blast everytime I change to a new game, if you want to do it once at the start of a game fine.
4. Infrequent crashes to the desk top, when selecting the Remaining Pieces option.
5. Can't be bought as a gift...really?
6. Stop the new admin chat every time i switch to a game, all it does is flag the chat notification flag so i never know if I have a new message.
7. Stop asking for the config every time I open the game or at least make it work.  Changes do nothing.

No detailed graphics or sound settings. Repetitive soundtrack. But so far I had no bugs. It just could have many more features for gamers who may not have enought time, or enough patience. For example it would help to alternate animation and move speeds. Would be nice to have more camra options as opposed to just top-down, and at an angle.  An AI move hint system could make the game friendlier to newcomers to the game.

As far as Carcasonne as a board game (not this particular software of Carcasonne) then in my opinion this is one of the best strategy board games. It is relatively simple. The core of the game is based on your memory, calculations(such as card counting), and future planning. You don't have to choose cards to pick, to hold, or tomake moves with. Cards are given to each player one at a time, per turn. Then you decide where to attach it to the whole map and which resource/area/structure to claim for yourself. Once it gets complete you get points. 
It may seem simple at first but it is not simple at all to win consistently with stronger AIs. A game can last about 5 minutes if you do not take any time to make a move. But the game is such that one match never looks like another due to open endedness and wide selection of move choices.

The UI is quite bad.  For instance, hovering over any buttons (and I think I tried all of them) will not tell you what they are.  This game is on Steam, yet you MUST have an Asmodee account to do any sort of mutiplayer and to ""buy"" the Abbott expansion.  ""Buy"" is in quotation marks, because you can only get the Abbott if you sign up for their account.  No less than 3 buttons on the main menu page directed you to create an account.  Even if you select your proper screen size, the buttons are  all apparently sized at 5000x - they are HUGE.  The remaining tiles are presented in two rows of 4 huge pictures so good luck scrolling through if you have 80+ tiles left in the pile.  You can't use WASD to move the map, you can't rotate the board to look at it from a differnt angle, and the tile graphics look like they need to be smoothed and I ran it at the highest setting.  

The feature I thought was the best was that you can toggle a button to view what areas are yours - that's actually a great addition but it's not enough to keep this in my library.

This game is a perfect example of a company ruining a great game with bad implementation & NO AFTER SUPPORT :/

Cons - 

- The game constantly crashes

- The ""ai"" that takes over from you when ure game crashes - has the same amount of intelligence as concrete.

- The UI is very very bad

- You have to sign into a separate Asmodee account even tho were in 2020 & you have bought it via another online store.

- If your stuck in a game where some1 decides to leave or forget they were playing ... you have no option to kick and have to wait they allocated turn time which could be anything from 15 mins to 2 hrs :/

- The servers constantly disconnect, so if u like ure 4-5 player games, be sure u will only be playing 2-3 & a few ""BAD AI"" at the end.


AND THE BIGGEST REASON - This game was released in 2017 - 4 years ago & its STILL NOT FIXED!!!!       If you look thru the forums, all you see is people complaining about the same things over and over and over, most of which I have also mentioned too

Yet all asmodee do is send you more e-mails about the ""new"" games they have created and do f-all to fix a product they know has got issues.

Pros -

There is ONLY 1 good thing I can say about this game - Its carcassone ... If ure desperate to play it ... this is all uve got.

I honestly hope that asmodee goes down and fails as a company, at least they will know how EVERYONE who bought this game feels.   Hopefully the the licence rights will go to a company that ""cares"" about games they release.   Even EA try to fix things ... says it all :/

(Old review) ---- 

Ive actually come back to update my review so ""I can now recommend this game"" as I did/could not before ( see old review below ).

I dont know if they have released a sneaky patch since the last but I have to report that within the last month, the game has seemed to have stabalized??

- It is no longer disconnecting me, my friends or other players from online games 
- It now tallys up the score at the end fully even if it goes for a long time ( so u can see who won )

The achivements problem constantly re-appearing everytime u play a game is still there, so I hope the Dev is aware of this and plans to fix.

The rest of the review stays the same, its still a pretty basic game .... but at least it works 90% now and I can get on with enjoying the game rather than worrying about the problems that could occour.

Review changed to "" Recommended ""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Even older review below left on 29 October, 2018)

Played since it since it was released on the xbox arcade .... I love Carcassonne and was pleasantly surprised when they released a copy on steam but i was a little dissapointed that i had to sign up to a 3rd party before i could play :(

The UI, menu`s & configurable options are basic .. but gets the job done.

The profile options on the Asmodee website are very basic ... but they get the job done.  (u cant change ure profile in game??(Its 2018 not 1998)

The online play would be great if it didnt keep throwing up problems all of the time ... atm approx every 1 in 3 games I will 
disconnect one of the players or the whole game will crash & by the time the player has re-opened the game and re-joined, the Ai that takes over has pretty much destroyed that players game :(   and to rub salt in the wounds - if you do not stay in the game until the end (games last approx 40 mins) youre karma will take a hit too :(

Ive got 7 crash reports already and the asmodee website tells me that I have played 16 games only :/

Also the achivements system is broken atm as it keeps on giving u the same achivement over and over every game u have which can get annoying.

For such a small game, problems as bad as this should have been rectified before it was released on steam!

If youre cluckin to play carcassone tho, for approx £7 ure not going to be dissapointed, but the Devs really need to fix the bugs for me to change my mind and give it a thumbs up.

The reason being that there has been a bug in the game for many, many months now where players don't get to see their final scores in the game on most occassions.  There's not much point playing a multiplayer game if you don't know who won!!!

I bought the physical version of Carcassonne two weeks ago on a Saturday morning.  After a couple of games with a friend and working out how to play it I decided to invest in this digital version.  It seemed like a good game and playing the digital version was going to ensure I'd understood the rules properly.

Since then I've played 35 hours of the digital version.  It's an great adaption of the board game and it has some advantages over the physical version that go beyond having to tidy up after playing!  The digital version shows were tiles can be placed (or not placed) and you can toggle on/off which ""fields"" you have control of.  Of course the game totals up all the scores during the game and end-game so no mental arithmetic too!

The physical version has many expansions and these are planned for release during 2018 as DLC.  At preent there is just the one DLC, which is ""The River"". 

The game is quite easy to learn.  You basically take a tile, which will depict roads, settlements, monastries, etc and have to place the tile down on the table making sure all the sides match to any other sides that the tile is placed alongside.  You then have an option to place a ""Meeple"" on a feature of the tile (road, field, city, etc).  You score when you complete a city or road or have a monastry surrounded by 8 tiles wherby you have a meeple on that feature.  In the event of more than one player having meeples on the feature the points go to whoever has more meeple on the feature, or if it is equal then points are shared.   I won't go into any more depth regards to how to play, but that's basically the gist of how the game works.

With Carcassonne being cross-platform it's prettty easy to get an online multiplayer game.  There's maybe an average of around 100 people playing at all times and the longest I've had to wait is a couple of minutes to find a game.

The game displays the tiles in an isometric view but this can be switched to 2D.  Isometric looks better in my opinion and seems to display more of the tiles without having to scroll around as much as in than the top-down view.

I bought the game a couple of weeks after the price increase of €5 but am happy that it has provided more than value for money so far.

I can't recommend this game enough, if you're into digital board games then you can't really go wrong with this purchase.",1517775124,1540323592

But you might be left wanting if you're a big fan of the tabletop version. All in all, this is a great way to get into Carcasonne, which is an amazing game, or an easy way to get a quick fix on your computer. 

For Carcassone afficianados, this is merely a serviceable version. It's a bit overpriced and lacks the expansions (with the DLC the full deck is ~80 cards), including some of the expansions available on the mobile version. The interface is clearly mobile oriented too, I bet it would be great on a Surface/touchscreen (if compatible), but it leaves a bit to be desired for proper mouse/keyboard input control. The camera controls are a bit too wonky (panning and zooming is awkward), but the graphics are significantly improved from mobile. Its quite beautiful for a tabletop PC game, and its nice to see those cities pop-up to life upon completion. The Pass & Play (local multiplayer) is a bit lacking, you cannot pick your own username or color in Pass & Play. And you can pick only your color in solo/online. The UI was ""distracting"" for my wife, I think the vibrancy of the board and the beautiful 3D embellishments on the cards can camoflauge the pieces a bit, but thats not a big problem. My only real complaints are the lack of support for 21:9 monitor resolutions (get with the times!) and of course the obvious lack of the extra expansions and cards... but I imagine they're planning to piece out those DLCs slowly to keep us hooked.

I definitely recommend this game for anyone new to Carcasonne or as an imperfect but pretty fix for hardcore fans of the tabletop.

Thankfully, this Steam edition does a great job of teaching you the rules, and has everything I would ask for in a digital version of a board game. Everything is laid out in an easy-to-understand way, and it's all pretty intutive. The presentation is cute and I love the little 3D models of the buildings. The AI is good and even the Easy AI is engaging and makes you think to have to win. They also include a lot of nice Quality of Life stuff like being able to see what fields you control. Carcassone is a fun game and it definitely benefits from having a computer take care of the scoring for you. 

The most pleasing part of this package is the cross-platform multiplayer. This is a huge deal for any digital board game, as it means that the playerbase won't be split between different versions of the game. I think this should be a standard feature of any board game adaptation and I'm certainly glad to see it here.

The only minor complaint I have is that you can't rotate the camera manually. There's not really any practical need to and the existing cameras are fine, but it does feel a bit stiff/restrictive compared to something like Tabletop Sim, where you can look at the game from any angle.

However, throw in the extra complexity of multiple resource types and resources that unlock gradually as you advance through the time periods and the resources become relevant.

76561197968364493,598960,True,0,0,0,1493,473,910,18,"After watching/reading a few videos/articles on train signals and an epiphany later I am changing my review to wholeheartedly recommendation. Seems my issue with tokens was due to the lack of production caused by my confusion with the signal system. I think it would be helpful to get a block visualizer for tracks so that I can properly set up my signals.  As for the epiphany, I realized that one must provide enough room for a train to turn around properly. If a train is too long and the train reverses with the cab then extending beyond a signal, then that signal is ignored and the next signal in line becomes the decider.  This meant my trains were always stuck. I know I can turn the whole magic reverse feature off for a more ""realistic"" experience, but I'm a Locomotion/Transport Tycoon veteran so I'm stuck in my ways.  

Negatives:  Truck still commit suicide when crossing train tracks despite signals.  Over time all your road vehicles crossing tracks will eventually get destroyed.  This needs to fixed ASAP. Other than that, this game scratches that big Locomotion (my favorite transport tycoon game) in all the right places.

Original Review follows for context:


""I like this game. It reminds me of my favorite tycoon game Locomotion. However I cannot recommend the game in its current state.  Crash to desktop are frequent. These CTD’s are not the main reason for my disappointment.  

Train signals are the biggest issue for me.  Using both automatic and manual placement of signals I was unable to get a functioning bypass track to work properly. My only solution was ultrawide stations with one train per track which in turn eats up all of my coal tokens.  

Vehicles ignore railroad crossings and eventually destroy themselves when getting hit by trains. ALL of my buses (10) between two cities were destroyed this way. The solution was to route road around the track.  Not ideal.

The token system while a cool idea I think needs reworking.  Despite delivering tons upon tons of coal I still ran out of coal tokens.  

Finally, the issue that prompted me to write this review after spending 7 hours in the game was oil. I created a station at an oil well and the other station at a refinery. I setup a train with tankers, set the schedule, and selected the green flag to send it on its way. The train ignored the oil wells all together.  It never stopped.  Thinking I may need to add a specialty extension I open up the extensions tab in the oil well station.....and nothing.  

I really like this game as I said in the beginning of this review. I’m the type of person that will pickup early access games, play a half hour or so, and then let them “cook” for a while before revisiting.  This is what is I did with Mashinky. It’s clear this game needs more time.  I’ll revisit the game again later after a few updates and revise this review should the updates warrant a change. 

In summary, at this time I cannot recommend this game in its current state.""",1615124790,1615732316

- Prudent design approach, not to demanding to run and looks good enough.

Generally you try to progress through the ages, from steam to electricity, so to get bigger and faster trains/wagons and such.

It's an impressive early access game.

As far as complaints, the generated maps usually have some cities that are logged into a mountainside or situated in odd locations which can be a bit annoying. Another issue I keep running into is how cities and resource sites spawn into the world as you progress through the ages, so you can spend 2 hours crafting the perfect railway to suddenly have an oil field and a town pop up in the next age right next to it so you have to rebuild everything.

Thanks for creating this game!  I spend a lot of time playing it, and it's (mostly) great!

I have one complaint, which will affect the longevity of my enjoyment.

I would like to see the industries much more balanced.  At the moment, it is really easy to max out an industry so that it is over-whelmed by inputs.  It is not uncommon of me to have two forests feeding a sawmill, where the sawmill is absolutely full of logs and is only creating a few lumber at a time.

I would like it if there were many more opportunities to expand the capacity of industries to process raw materials, and fewer opportunities of raw materials to be improved (and so-on up the chain).

Sid Meyers Railways had an interesting dynamic where goods would flow slowly to their next point in the production chain, but if you provide another form of transport this would be used in preference.  (So merchants or passengers would prefer to travel by train than by bus, but if neither is provided, they would walk.

I make this criticism in the hopes that your good game can become even better.

Kind regards

There are already mods available through the Steam workshop, and I hope some of the content gets incorporated into the game- but that's not necessary.

I have played most games in this style that are out there, and sadly Mashinky hits a couple of ""red flags"" for me which make it hard to recommend over alternatives like OpenTTD (which, sadly, none of the 3D games in this genre can truly rival).

So, the things I dislike here are:
1) Treating passengers and mail like just another kind of freight. In reality, any transport system will have an increased number of passengers with increased number of destinations, whereas a coal mine doesn't suddenly produce twice as much coal if you connect it to two foundries. And in reality, passengers and letters have a set destination, whereas coal is largely indifferent in this regard.
2) You do not earn money by transporting raw resources and intermediate products (e. g. ore, timber) to a factory. In reality, transport companies are paid for transporting stuff.

Those two points are entirely counter-intuitive, and they make this game feel more like a game, and less like a simulation. Point #2 also makes it a lot harder for you to run an entirely or mostly freight-based corporation. Without easy money from passengers, you will not be able to afford freight operations.

3) The switch between ""realistic"" and tile-based view isn't organic. On the contrary - the ""realistic"" view does not look all that great, but completely prevents you from actually, y'know, playing the game. Meanwhile, the tile-based view looks unnecessarily ugly, with the LOD boundary being clearly visible at all times, stuff looking out of focus, and a lack of clarity.
4) The UX is unnecessarily clumsy. For example, when creating a train ""schedule"" / task list, you can't just click on a bunch of stations, you need to click the ""Add Station"" button, then click the station, rinse, repeat. And if you want to add a station where the train should wait for full load, there is no modifier key to do it in one go - instead you have to press an additional menu button after adding the station. (There might be a modifier key, but if there is, I could not find it.)

I don't want to bash this game, it is in a genre I really like and it is basically alright. But there are so many railway management games that are ""basically alright"", and none that are really great and elevate the genre above the standards set in the early 90es, and to me that is kind of sad. In 2018, Mashinky looked to me as if it might be the game to finally get it right, but I don't think it does.",1597002091,1597002091

The game has a bizzare token system where passenger trains make money,  wood hauling trains make wood tokens, coal trains coal tokens and steel hauling trains steel tokens, diesel tokens, electric tokens and so on...

These tokens are used to buy trains, research new trains and for running costs.

This creates a needless hassle of things like ""I need to expand my wood hauling to keep my passanger trains running because they run on wood tokens"" - you will find yourself juggling these stupid tokens. If you want to just focus on industry - you can't because you need cash to build, if you want to focus on passangers, you can't because you need industry to advance. There is constant juggling of these lines - for reasons I just cannot explain.

I give it a thumbs up because I feel this game has real heart, a strong attention to detail and realism, and great potential, but be careful before you buy it in its present state. I won't lie and say I didn't have fun with it, I did, but it gets stale pretty quick at present, and simply adding more eras through which to progress (as the developer seems intent on doing) won't address the reasons it becomes stale - not in any way.

EDIT: Author appears to be adding improvements in other areas besides just more eras, and this is good to see. I have removed the bit about single-player only, because the author has made quite clear that they intend to add multiplayer, they just haven't gotten there at the time of this writing/update. Track laying on inclines also feels easier than I remember it pre-updates, but I'm not sure if that was actually improved, or I'm just giving the game more slack now.

Unlike other train sims that give you a lot of freedom when building track, this one seems intent to find ways to limit you. Tunnels and bridges are very restrictive in what they can cross over or go under (buildings and stations are out for example, and the engineering marvels of track over tunnels, under bridges, and under other bridges, etc which I have built in other train sims are just impossible here). What's more, tunnels and bridges may only be built EXACTLY north-to-south or east-to-west. Forget about simply building a tunnel at a 45 degree angle from town (like you probably need) and to make matters worse I often let up on the mouse where I want the tunnel only to have the tunnel not get built with no explanation -despite no red markers I can see that usually indicate why something can't be built. Want to provide service to that town inexplicably built on the side of a mountain? You'll either tear down half the mountain, make it twice the size, or both, while trying to build a depot there and get track in and out.

The industries are always WAY outside of town and the towns don't seem to have any interest in the commodities the industries generate anyway. (Forget about selling your processed lumber in towns of any size - they don't want it unless you turn it into crates way up the supply chain. Passenger transport becomes meaningless late game because money is no longer the currency you use. [EDIT: Passenger transport is now more fun because in a recent update people actually want to go to specific destinations now, instead of just jumping off wherever the train stops - BUT due to the barter economy it will always be useless late game.]

You use processed coal and metals, and so forth, but you don't sell them you use them to build and fuel more and more modern trains. Seems like a real missed opportunity that you don't actually buy or sell those materials. Also be warned: the factories that process raw materials are almost NEVER placed near the raw materials they process (seems to be chance based during map generation), but neither are they placed near towns. This forces you to build a LOT of track from this side of the map to the other and back again.

On the good side: I love the progression from steam locomotives to more modern counterparts and the realism and detail that goes into every engine and every car. The trains behave realistically, and you can program their routes stop by stop or just set them loose and let the AI engineer figure it out. I love that I can actually place locomotives opposite facing on either side of a train -just like the real life trains I see going by all the time. This won't matter to a lot of players I realize, but attention to detail and realism are things I really respect, and this game hits all the right check-marks. If you enable it so, trains will have to back their way out of track segments if you don't provide a way for them to turn around.

I'm still going to recommend it, for all the things it does right, the obvious effort that went into it, and the fact that it does seem to be improving. But I caution prospective buyers in the process: there's a lot of work that needs to be done here still. Wait for it to develop more, or understand that even after seven years you are still buying a product very much a work-in-progress.",1587711835,1599374994

Did you have a blast playing games like Sim City 4? 
Do you enjoy watching beautiful trains rolling through pretty scenery?
If these describe you then odds are good you will like Mashinky. 

Mashinky allows you to plan & build railroads on its grid-based map. You start the game in the early steam age with the choice of locomotives that were barely able to pull much more than themselves down the track, & progress through various other ages unlocking new industries for your rail empire to serve & new, more powerful locomotives to serve them with. As of Dec 2018 there are 4 eras to play through (2 different steam eras, & 2 diesel eras). Each era (at present) unlocks 3 or 4 locomotives to choose between (once reaching the 4th era many of the old steamers are retired from production & no longer able to be purchased beyond what stock you already own, but this does seem fairly logical) & several new industries. In the year+ that I’ve owned this game, the developer has been steadily adding features (steadily, but not rapidly -they have added eras 2 and 3 within about a 1.5 year span so understand that their planned 7 eras once the game is finished will take a while). Despite that, Mashinky is extremely enjoyable as it is already (so long as you are not playing it solely to unlock a futuristic bullet train that does not exist in game yet) & despite being an early access title I would highly recommend.

One of the features that sets it apart from other games like it that I’ve played is that it uses “tokens” instead of cash for currency when building/collecting fees for your railroad empire. This initially seems odd & even a little awkward but, after logging more than 300 hours in Mashinky, I can say that it’s actually a brilliant design that gives Mashinky more longevity than similar games. Let me explain: in games that have a single currency (ie cash), typically if you play them long enough you find there are 1 or 2 methods that give you the highest return on your investments and thus players tend to turn their empires into a 1-trick pony (maybe passenger lines give better returns than freight so your railroad becomes purely a passenger line, ignoring freight entirely). Even if you don’t do that, there always comes a point where your past work has netted so much cash that you basically can't run out of money which takes the challenge out of the game & makes the mid-late game feel too easy/pointless. With Mashinky, you have different tokens to earn (cash, wood, coal, iron, oil, steel, etc) starting with only cash wood & coal & adding new tokens with each new era. Different cargoes reward different tokens (passengers reward cash, oil trains are used to produce oil, etc) and you need different tokens for each thing (cash is for most infrastructure, with other tokens used for some buildings & to buy and maintain rolling stock). While wood and coal tokens are useful for running some trains at the start, later on those tokens will be more valuable for building specific buildings while you develop newer industries & fuel your company’s conversion to more powerful diesels. This encourages diversifying since you will need each of the currencies for something important, & also means that even if you run a hugely successful passenger line in the early game, you won’t have so much money that everything feels trivial once you move into the diesel age (maybe you could lay track like crazy, but you can’t just buy 100 shiny new diesels the moment they are unlocked if all you have on hand is cash tokens). This system makes locomotive and wagon choice a bit more interesting: Sure you could buy only the biggest beast of a locomotive that is available in any given era, but you have to consider the cost. Maybe the beast guzzles oil tokens and you haven't developed your oil production enough to comfortably add that upkeep, so maybe the older workhorse running on coal tokens you’ve stockpiled makes more economic sense for the moment. Maybe you’re on a map where you’re hard pressed to produce enough iron tokens to buy tons of huge rail cars to transport your goods, but you have wood aplenty & that will do for buying slightly smaller cars for the trains that aren’t hauling as much.
It is honestly a bit different to get used to, but I find it’s actually a refreshing way to keep each new era (& each locomotive/carriage choice) interesting, valid, and non-trivial. In my opinion it works a lot better than simply inflating prices each era when using a single currency. For this feature alone this game is worth a look.

A HUGE pro for Mashinky in my opinion is also that once you’re tired of the nuts-and-bolts of laying your lines, choosing the locomotives & cars best suited to your situation, and setting your trains about their tasks, you can pop into the drivers seat (or a passenger car, boxcar, etc.) on any of your trains and take a ride through the countryside taking in the scenery (& this game is beautiful in this mode complete with pretty details like foliage changing colors in the fall, snow covering the ground (& your train) when traveling through the mountains in winter & everything in between). 
It has a plethora of tools to use (does take some learning as not everything is intuitive for everyone -for instance learning how to get signals working like you want can confuse some people, but once you learn how, the systems here do work very well). 

Negatives: 
-Cannot change world settings once you have begun a world (ie: if you originally had the map set to “automatically flip trains” (meaning if a train hits the end of the line it magically flips about so that the engine is pointing back in the direction it came from), & decide you want the added challenge of having trains reverse instead (moving in reverse typically slows the train by 1/2) you can't just change that setting without starting a new map.
-Cannot (at present) delete or create new industries or towns. This can be looked at simply as a challenge, but if you choose a map with a high spawn rate for industries, after a few eras worth of them spawning, It might get tricky to lay routes between all of the unnecessary industry buildings (it should be noted that creating/deleting industries, etc is a feature that is intended to be added, so while it may be a nuisance to some at the time I’m writing this review in Dec 2018, eventually this should be fixed)
-Not all of the planned eras are in the game yet. 4 eras in & we’re a bit past mid-20th century in technology at the most advanced. I don’t really consider this a con because the game is amazing as it is & I feel that I have gotten my money’s worth & then some already.
-Finally laying tracks on slopes can be frustrating (namely, trying to put curves in the tracks on slopes -this game only allows curves to be placed on flat pieces of land). While it’s not a big deal at all once you get used to it (the game has various terraforming tools that can be used to raise/lower/level terrain when needed), this can be frustrating while learning what things you can and can’t do in the game.

Final Verdict: It is still in development so if not having all planned features in the game yet or if the chance a mechanic changes slightly bothers you then hold off for the final release. For me to recommend an early access game I ask myself: ""If development stopped & it was left in its current state, would it still be worth the money?"" My answer here is an enthusiastic yes. This is a rare game I can play for 100+hrs over the course of months, move on to another game for a while & come back when they add a new era and sink another 100+hrs in & love every minute of it. Add to it, that in 300+hrs of playtime I’ve not run into a single major bug that I can recall, then if you like management games, model railroading or are just a train enthusiast I can honestly highly recommend Mashinky even in early access.",1586108558,1586111676

I enjoy this game and hope some of the shortfalls will be fixed soon. It was worth the money I spent so far. How long I will stick with it depends on how development progresses.
If I had one thing to say to the developer, it would be please focus a bit more on some of the basic improvements that are needed, rather than adding or changing detail features, like how map icons look. I understand that’s important too, but for me I would much rather fix performance issues and path finding bugs before thinking about icons.

PRO:
+ Signals, the only rail game I know that has the pre-signal type and it makes so many designs possible!!!
+ Tracklaying method allows building in confined spaces without accidentally snapping to the wrong rails like in so many other games like this
+ Isometric flair (although not actually isometric) is a computer game time travel
+ Pathfinding is among the best I know (see below for bugs)
+ Era concept with increasing complexity of options and freight types keeps very long games interesting
+ In its quirkiness it is somehow pretty (in building mode)
+ Quick loading times (as opposed to Transport fever titles for example)
+ Easy on the GPU and memory
+ Workshop support, although limited in choice
+ Good mod-ability in self-service, e.g. you don't like the speed something is going, game files are easily understood, and config files are editable as text files, e.g. just increase speed on bridges

CONTRA:
- Multicore performance is a disaster, the game can basically only use one core and rotates back and forth between two cores to balance thermals but does not gain any performance from that. On very big maps with lots of traffic the game begins to stutter at some point and when extreme becomes unplayable - VERY SAD!
- Track laying :-) Bridges cannot be diagonal, slopes cannot be in curves - I played Chris Sawyers Locomotion a lot and with at the flaws that had, the super dense infrastructure that was possible with sloped curves was amazing! Please! Add sloped curves and curvy bridges
-  Some UI issues, defining routes or editing them is kinda 15 years outdated, it works but it's really not up to standards
- Railway stations get numbered, you can re-name them but I am truly still waiting for a game that understands what is in the catchment area of a station and names them accordingly, for example Town and Industry type...at least as an option
- Route naming - see above, same principle
- Path finding works very good in most circumstances but on very large maps or when you are starting to hit the CPU limits, trains with long distances and many branches on the way to their next destination get lost and stop, leading to major traffic issues (I'd love it if they would just keep on trying, at least as an option). Currently, if such things happen, you need to set routes with intermediate waypoints, problematic if your network changes, or build shortcuts
- Well, the elephant in the room. This game has been in development by a single guy, Jan Zeleny, since I don't know when. It's impressive what he has done and things are going a bit faster since a few people kicked in to help I think but it still is more of a hobby than a serious development I think…so graphics are ~10 years behind and some UI issues etc. will never get fixed I am sure.",1585478444,1585479022

Or how a train set might look if you could jump in to an engine, wagon or coach, with a first or third person perspective. This may not appeal to true train sim fans, those looking for realistic physics and visuals, for example, elevation changes and curves can feel a bit sharp, when riding along with the trains. Perhaps in the future, the game will get smoother curves, and smoother gradient options. But as it is, this is part of it's charm to me.

Another great feature of Mashinky, is the ability to change the landscape, late game you can afford to build or remove mountains, if the urge takes you. I have enjoyed having at least one or two long scenic routes, that I modelled, on large maps, where just going along for the ride is quite cathartic and relaxing.

Fans of Open TTD will likely feel at home here, while it has yet to have the whole depth of OTTD, it certainly draws on it for inspiration. I have had a lot fun with this game since not long after release, and I come back for more every few months, to try out any new changes and enjoy another scenic ride or two!

Incredible too, when you realise, initially this was a labour of love from just one developer for a number of years.

If you like all things trains, you would be missing out if you did not at least give this a try, and or look in to it, just a bit further.

Constructing the railways are not as restrictive as other games, making it a lot easier to actually build and organize a rail network, and the modular stations (seriously, thank you for those!) really make it so much more accesible to expand your network.
Mashinky is not without faults, and at the time of writing the game occasionally crashes (once every 3-4 hours maybe), but the autosave is by default on a 1 minute interval and it is scarcely noticeable when it saves.

The art style is pleasant, the rail management is good, and the newly added trucks add a nice way to patch the annoying little corners that don't quite rate a train line.

The use of multiple currency tokens creates an interesting dynamic. Instead of concentrating in on one or two specific cargoes and routes, one has to haul a variety of cargoes in order to build an efficient railroad. Iron and lumber take on additional needs as they're needed in substantial amounts in order to get the best cargo cars. Coal is not just useful for rail cars and engines, but also is a fuel for some engines. As one rolls into more and more modern eras, some resources (like coal) start to be less needed for their raw tokens (and thus fuel for your engines), but a replacement demand for power generation soon comes along to take up the slack.

One of the funnest parts (for me) is the ability to upgrade and expand your train stations and your industries. As you haul more resources, you can expand the output of various industries, or give them entirely new production chains that can take advantage of extra resources.",1578630987,1578630987

This scratches that Transport Tycoon itch very, very well. It is NOT a business simulation, nor does it aspire to be. It has a token tabletop-style system, more or less the same way the original Transport Tycoon had. Ultimately, this game is about laying tracks, solving track-laying problems and watching trains run (and crash if you make a mistake) in your carefully laid-out track system. It is a lot of fun. 

It is not however a completed game. The trains are not balanced for the game, there are not too many of them, they only go up to a certain era, etc. This game needs lots and lots of working hours before it can be considered even half-completed. 
The game designer is not trying to hide this, and it is made clear from the start that this is an alpha build still in development. As a result, the replayability is rather low at the moment.
Even in its embryonic state though, the game is fun to play and clearly a labour of love.

In the time since I began with this game, I have found the simple systems to be enjoyable to assemble. It has proven to be a satisfactory combination with podcasts.

This game works with a very simple token system. Along with a grid-based construction overlay in which a significant portion of the game time will be spent in, Mashinky has a strong boardgame aesthetic, which is a design choice that suits the rail-oriented logistics sim just fine. There is no immersive and punishing economic management layer. Depleting token reserves intended for fuel is a hazard that needs to monitored, but need hardly be compared to spinning plates. This game doesn't attempt to reflect the competitive nature of the actual railroad scamble during the 19th/20th century. As of the time of this review, multiplayer isn't yet a feature, and thus each map is a blank slate. The option of being left behind by the advancement of technology is also entirely optional, although bizarrely one that is listed under the ""hard"" preset difficulty. 

The only threat in this game is the arbitrary placement of randomly generated industry buildings. It can be amusing to witness oil wells spawn in on top of mountains, or have farms appear right in the middle of over-developed towns. 

The game is early access. A lot of content is missing. Some trains appear to be the labour of love that appear their authentic counterparts, whereas some have the interior that is just an empty block. Smooth gradients and embankments are restricted by the game's grid structure. Tight turns made necessary by some multi-platform stations and major junctions result in rolling stock clipping in what would pose the serious risk of derailing. As a disclaimer, I am not an engineer. Some of these problems are works in progress. Some of these problems are limitations of the engine. This is all fine. 

Mashinky perhaps not so strangely, put me at ease with the tools to effectively create little virtual train sets, that in turn recently caused some interest in learning more about trains, and to some fascinating subcultures like heritage railways and freight-hopping ( I do not endorse criminal and potentially lethal activity - although there is a deep and vibrant hobo community out there on the web, with footage, I'm just saying...). 

I look forward not to seeing where the development of this game leads, and what the final product will look like. For what it is, I am done with the experience for the time being, but I don't regret my purchase.",1577044871,1577044871

While the game is still under development, I'm nervous that the developer has not signaled an interest in supporting diagonal roads - a seemingly minor design element, but which would help cut down on the very unrealistic look that cities and transport networks take on as they expand. Mashinky operates in a more rigid grid-based construction system than other games like Transport Fever, and this is actually one of its top selling points, as hitting the space bar enables switching between a 'realistic' cinematic view of your transport network, and a grid view with more cartoonish representations of the topography and play area. Rail stations and buildings must be placed at 90 degree angles, although rail tracks can, mercifully be placed at diagonals in order to weave through mountains and along rivers. But, for now, roads can only be built at 90 degree angles, meaning building ""diagonal"" roads end up involving hundreds of right and left turns.

Also, unlike Transport Fever, which starts in 1850, Mashinky covers a shorter timespan from 1920 onward, and it would nice if the game's internal clock moved slower, since it currently doesn't take much time to start moving through the game's 5 ages. It would be better if time moved a bit slower, enabling players to savor some of the earlier time periods and equipment, before the world starts to change and old school cars/trains begin to be phased out.

Those points aside, the development team is responsive to user feedback, and we're still a long ways away from this project's completion, so I'm holding out hope Mashinky will blossom into something great. And it helps that, even in its current state, it's a fun, challenging, and often beautiful game. Great work, Jan!",1575337456,1575337456

Either the trains get so stuck that its the ultimate entangled garden hose excercise or I feel like I am trying the pull several threads through the eye of a needle, as every kind of goods need to go to every one of the 30 cities on the map.

This game however is the exception for me . Its quite complicated, but at the same time its very logic and cleverly designed so that its easy to keep tack of what you are doing. Its so well thought out, yet, its very forgiving and its super chill. 

I would say its definitely is the most fun Ive had in a transport management game since the days Railroad Tycoon was king.  Its really just one giant sandbox, and it allows you to do as you please. However, at the same time it sets goals so that you have objectives to chase.  But only if you want... That said, if they are turned on and you miss the objectives, its not like you are going to be sent you to your room.  Actually the goals help you to learn the different tiers of complexity as you progress, like a very subtle tutorial. The game teaches you how to play it as you go along. It assumes you have a brain and its not going to tell you  how to use the WASD keys or  rediscover what the middle mouse button does when gaming on a PC. 

Even though this is early access, it plays like a fully fleshed out game. I cannot remember the last time I have been so immersed. To me this is up there with classics like Banished / Factorio / Prison Architect. Its a superb blend of immersion, intelligent design, and replayability, that makes it the kind of game you would want to come back to again and again.  In short, its a future classic.  

On the flipside, I was reminded of the Early Access status as the game crashed unexpectedly a few times. Maybe four or five in the 7 hours Ive played.  That said, the autosave is set to 1 minute, so you never loose much, and its very discreet when it saves,  you don't notice it at all. A bit like getting back to MS Word when you shut it down prematurely to get out of the office.  Even though Mashinky is beautiful, it could probably run on an upgraded toaster and it loads almost as fast as Tetris. 

As an oldtimer who has been playing train sims since the 90s. this one is up there among the best. And for those who think its expensive... How many forgettable Skinny Latte's can you buy at that unmentionable Seattle Coffeee company..? Two ? Three?

This game is about building complex supply chains with railroads. The economy is a bit strange, but it works and is meaty.

The 3D and riding trains is fun for a time, but I found that whole side more gimmicky than useful. Out of my 90 hours, I probably have spent 89 of them in the more bland building mode that makes it easier to place and manipulate tracks. I'm not knocking the riding thing, just don't go in thinking that is a major gameplay aspect.

Bugs are noticeable, as expected of an early access. The most frustrating part of this game is the interface such as too many windows and subfolders with limited shortcuts. I am particularly annoyed about the unnecessarily complex manner to pick cars for trains. You also can’t clone trains once they are already out hulling which is super annoying. 
Granted, these complains are minor in the grand scheme of things, and I expect them to get ironed out as the game develops.

The biggest things I think this is missing is having an AI to compete against, business management, and any type of real missions. Without any competition, there is no sense of urgency. While some may like this, I find it can sometimes get boring after a while – particularly during the end game. As for missions, the game has them, but they are uninteresting things like a popup telling you to “move 100 wood to this lumber mill.” 

The developer is active, with regular updates and communication.

I know this review might appear a bit negative, but the game itself is already enjoyable enough for me to look past my gripes. If the game was called finished now, I would still be content with my purchase at $25, if not disappointed at a loss opportunity for a truly epic tycoon game. You can lose track of time in Mashinky which is always a hallmark of a good tycoon game, and when you finish the last era and look upon a complex maze of track and signals and dozens of trains, you feel a real sense of accomplishment.

Also the UI looks like from the 90s and really is user unfriendly.

Already a very enjoyable game in spite of it's alpha stage!  Have been playing just over 27 hours. Takes me back to the days of Sid Meier - Railroad Tycoon series in many ways, just with much better graphics.

I am impressed with the ""Isometric"" planning  vs.  ""realistic mode"" aspect of this simulation. Extremely well implemented so far.  The planning mode allows me to work out the logistics / locations of resources, where and how to lay track to the various cities and varied industries while  monitoring train locations and resource levels.  Even though this mode is called ""Isometric"", you are not locked in to one angle. You can freely rotate to any camera angle required. Has a good feel to it overall. 

 The ""realistic mode"" is the highly detailed world that looks very good so far. I enjoy hopping on one of the trains and watching the world go by while admiring the detail of the locomotives and the towns and industries.

The game mechanics are a bit simplistic with track layout in some aspects (compared to other modern train sims), but doesn't detract from the quality of game play in my opinion. I can't decide if this is a ""feature"" or a ""work in progress"".

Impressive amount of mods for a game at this stage. Should be interesting to see what the modders come up with.

Overall this is an amazing game / sim with very much potential.  More polish than I've ever seen in an alpha stage program on Steam thus far. No buyer's remorse at all and with no discounts!  This is the kind of developer I am happy to hand my hard-earned cash to!

To the DEVELOPERS:  This game quality is what I hope for when looking for new game but rarely expect to find.  Pleasantly surprised! I look forward to seeing this game's progress with great anticipation! Amazing!

This is the sort of developer that deserves support from the community in my opinion!

Mashinsky has an extremely good interface and is just so much simpler in many regards that i'm wondering why noone else had these ideas before. The fact that you can build the way you build stations here is so much easier and convenient, the tracklaying works, signals are working out of the box, it's just in general slick. You built a train with just 2 stations ? Don't bother with giving it orders, it's gonna do the right thing automatically, just send it on it's way (opposed to most games where you have to click stations together).

The economy is also very cool, just because you have money doesn't mean you can buy everything, some of the advanced trains actually require you to have other ressources in stock, which turns the one dimensional game of the other games (either you have money or you dont) on the head.

There are some very advanced features missing but overall this is very close to replace my favourite logistics games.

- BEGIN FALSE STATEMENT -

Mashinky won't currently let you implement this (awesome) scenario of 2 city depos that have 4 tracks each and 7 trains total:

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1662083305

It's impossible with the current signalling, and most players implement unidirectional ""to"" and ""from"" parallel tracks across long distances - they never set up a single track that can run in both directions, because the current switches always eventually get 2 trains stuck facing each other due to race conditions.

BUT - if I had to bet on a railways sim that will eventually be capable, my bet would be on Mashinky, as it comes very close to getting it right.

Sections of tracks are separated into ""blocks"" as block semaphore signals are placed, which are recommended they be unidirectional.  Well then how did Sid Meier figure it out?  I don't know!  In SMR those signals are generated automatically whenever you add sidings!

In Mashinky, no signals are automatically generated and it's up to you to come up with a working scheme.

Here's my attempt, but it still runs into more than one train getting into the same block - so far it seems you really can only have one entrance and one exit for any given block, so that's why everyone uses unidirectional.  I can hardly hold this against the game:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1764140175

Even if they never figure it out - the game has a certain engineering purity that I really appreciate.  The UI is a little odd, but so far the gameplay has left me with no regrets, and I'm fairly certain this will long be my ""go to"" rail sim.

- END FALSE STATEMENT - 

UPDATE:
I am really happy to see that with the automatic signals and with the trains eventually timing out and reversing after being frozen long enough - all these jams never persist for very long, and you don't have to go in with a bulldozer anymore, at least not in this test scenario!  BRAVO!!!

I can just watch this for... well not for hours.. but minutes certainly!  It's quite mesmerizing.  It feels like a real train layout in your basement.  I am thoroughly tempted to make such a thing some day,  now that I've been hooked by this game.

It's also enough to just take the game as it is - there is a lot of enjoyment to be had here, and it still behaves very autonomously (unlike AHEM I'M LOOKING AT YOU THE RAILROAD SIM WHO SHALL NOT BE NAMED)...  Oh... sorry... excuse me:

Stamps in Workshop:

What else?  Well, the granular map using square tiles that can be angled in altitude, and the track laying designed around these tiles allows for publishing stamps on the workshop.  Or downloading stamps other people have published and learning what you think of the design.  I spend a HUGE amount of time thinking about how to publish these stamps, and looking at other people's designs.  Here's my favorite so far:

Frankly, I think the game designer is a genius. He has maximized the good*...fun trains, the feelings of satisfaction when you set things up well, and when you accomplish missions, etc., and minimized the silly hassles.  He has even managed to make the time pressures not hurt that much. 

I am almost always pausing RTS games in that I feel like I'll miss something if I don't, or I don't have enough time to get everything done. Somehow, that concern is not present here. Usually, I avoid games that deal in complexity because of the various kinds of hassles that arise.  I've been playing video games since DOOM in 1994, and Civ II was my first RTS game with compounding complexity.  Since then, I tend to avoid RTS games because of the hassles from bad design, balance, etc. So it might be saying something that I feel that I can manage the complexity of this game without too much effort. For me this is a rare treat. 

*Here are some specific examples illustrating why you should give this game a try:

1. Very easy to add tracks and signals, and remove them. Hassle factor is minimal.

2. Vital tracklaying feature:  You can add, then delete, track as much as you want until you get it right, and are charged only for the final layout. There was another, similar game that I won't mention here, that was difficult to get the track right...and if you deleted anything you didn't get any money back.  I thought, what good is a computer tool if it doesn't help you find a workable design, but penalizes you while you try and learn how to use it? Mashinky gets this important feature right.

3. Train pathfinding is quite good, and instantaneously updates when you make track changes. When there are errors, it's almost always your fault, not the game's having a bug. There are so many ways to setup a track network, and some of them are, like my first setup, really bad!

4. The game jumps in complexity, but only when you want it to. That is, you can choose** to deliberately pay to advance to the next ""era"" where new trains, industries and product are available. If you like your optimized setup as it is, then you can just let it run for a while, and you can marvel at how efficiently and nicely it works.  **In settings, before starting a new game.

5. You can seamlessly (yes, really) jump from ""build"" view to ""scenic"" view, and watch a train from any angle. Even from inside the locomotive or the cars. The artwork style looks...arty, kind of like an oil painting. Pretty, naturalistic.

6. Missions actually help you improve your rail and industrial network.  I think the game senses what you ought to be doing to prepare for the future, then prompts you to find a way to do this, through missions.  Even seemingly wasteful missions have a payoff that come in the future.

7. Doesn't stutter or pause. Doesn't make my (average for 2019) video card overheat, either.",1557953165,1558184340

Polished for an early access game, no bugs encountered. Trying to come up with efficient layout/routing and setting things in motion is fun. Graphics are pretty good, especially for what appears to be a one person effort. 

Could be improved:
Gameplay is rather repetitive. In your early game, you're establishing an base stream of income and resources and once you've got enough, the game basically is just connecting new places and moving stuff around, with some occasional remodeling to accommodate heavier traffic. I know there are people who enjoy this, but I personally need more variety and challenge to keep me engaged. 

UI annoys me at times with having to open and close everything. Would benefit a lot from a ""template"" feature that allows you to define a layout and place them repeatedly, like for common station and junction designs, instead of having to manually create the same thing over and over. 

Economy is simplistic. Cities grow, you can add extensions to stations and resource producers/converters, but that's it. Your ability to influence and therefore plan for future supply chains is basically nonexistent. Would like to see more complexity in this area. 

Trains are mostly straight upgrades over one another. You might settle for a train that has money upkeep instead of a resource currency, but like half of them are just deadweight. They need more differentiation in terms of top speed, acceleration, max freight, etc so there's actually a choice to make instead of spamming the highest throughput train.",1555914186,1555914186

- lack of fuel in later stages - unlike coal, only one type of factory delivery produces diesel tokens
- passengers do not have target destinations = motivation for large networks is lower
- occassional signaling issues - adding platform choose signal would help?
- simple tunnels and bridges: editable tunels and elevated bridges with curves / or at least diagonal bridges would add more building possibilities

The concept is simple and effective. Tracks are easy to lay-out and signals can be placed and configured to direct trains towards the correct tracks. With a bit of exercise and experimentation, you can create a fully automated railway network with multi-platorm stations and bridges and tunnels where you deem necessary.

Give your trains orders to go to certain stations and, if your layout and signalling is setup correctly, the AI will make sure they pick up the right materials (if they can carry them) and deliver them where requested, using all lines available on the network.

The game starts with an easy to understand resource and industry system, but gets more complex once you unlock the next age. The key (and fun) of the game is to keep expanding your existing network, trying to supply all industry buildings with the right materials so you get the resources to build more tracks and use new and better engines and wagons.

And if you're tired of building, just hop into one of your trains and enjoy the ride. And yes, you can also blow the whistle :)

As of writing, the game is still in early access. Several ages are not yet available. Yet, it's already a fully functional game. Maps are randomly generated and have a lot of tweaking options from very flat to a map full of lakes and mountains, so there's plenty of replayability. It should also be possible to make your own maps, but I haven't tried this yet.

Not only is it gorgeous to look at, but the gameplay is fun, rewarding, and unique. I have been looking for a spiritual successor to the Railroad Tycoon series for years and, so far, Mashinky is the only game that comes close. 

I loved the Railroad Tycoon franchise. Transport Fever looked really nice but fell way short in terms of its gameplay and the economic system. I feel like Mashinky combines the best of both worlds to make a really worthwhile experience. The game is just complex enough to be fun and challenging, while still being straight forward enough that it can be approached by wide audience.

If I was going to make a comparison, I would probably put the gameplay somewhere between Railroad Tycoon and Transport Fever. The former focuses more on economy and financials, whereas the second focuses on more logistics, routes, signal and track placement, etc. Mashinky employs a unique economic and progression system where the player doesn't only need to generate revenue, but also generate resources in order to advance and operate. The ""build"" vs ""non-build"" game modes is a really unique and interesting way to provide players a way to enjoy the beauty of the game away from all the HUD elements that are needed to play. I am surprised I haven't seen that used before.

The developer working on this project is very active with the community. He is completely transparent, and has provided a public road map so everyone in the community knows what direction the game is going in and the timeline for getting there. I don't usually back Early Access games anymore because I feel like too many independent developers on Steam's Early Access platform have taken advantage of backers by not delivering on their promises in one way or another. Sometimes it is features, their timeline, or seemingly abandoning their projects altogether after they make a certain amount of revenue built on the hype their game generates. I am confident this will not be the case with Mashinky and am happy I backed the project. I am already enjoying the game and have faith the finished project will be great once finished as well.

I don't have any cons about this game and am happy to give it a resounding thumbs up right now as it sits in alpha. 


PS: One thing I would like to say, which isn't a reflection on Mashinky at all, is just how unfortunate that it took this long to get Mashinky after Railroad Tycoon 3. I would also like to one day see a game that is just as in-depth financially as Railroad Tycoon was. I really enjoyed being able to run the company financials in that game-- Attempt mergers, change dividends, purchase stocks as a player, issue/buy back stocks and bonds, and even declare bankruptcy and start a new company within the same scenario. No tycoon game to date has come close to having that level of financial depth. Pop-Top Entertainment made a masterpiece with that series.

I started enthusiastically with building connection between 2 cities and withou waiting other parts of industry. Ended up without money to operate trains. So started new game.

Now I was bit more caucious about how to build and where to put tracks. I made it to 2nd era, but then 3 trains crashed into each other, because I wasn't using Routes of the trains and railway signal, which makes the trains stop, when there's another train crossing. So ended this game with many complicated routes and finally without money. 

But since then I was caught on it, so next new game I was being very caucious, starting renaming each train, train station and using Routes in train menu. Now I'm entering 4th era and basically love the game!

But dont be put off by the word ""promising"". That doesnt mean the game cant deliver right now, because it can.
At the moment there are about three games of this kind available. Rise of industry, Railway Empire and Mashinky. Of all three Mashinky is already the best by design and could easily become even better once all core features are implemented.
What gives this game an advantage are several intelligent design decisions and on top the potential implementation of multiplayer.
As for multiplayer: It is planned for up to 8 players and is part of the core game concept because there is no competitive AI involved. So all the competition would come from the multiplayer anyway.
As is, the roadmap indicates that there are still a few things to come before multiplayer gets involved. It might take a while until the implementation happens, but even now the game is richer than its competitors.

Why is that? The intelligent design decisions made change a few partly fundamental aspects of these games overall. They make Mashinky a game you know and love from previous similar titles, but also a game that comes with innovations.
One of those changes to the core formula are the tokens. Every resource in Mashinky is represented by tokens. When you transport passengers, you gain money tokens, that you use to build railroads and various other things.
When transporting and successfully delivering goods like coal, wood and many more, you gain equivalent tokens of those.
You use these tokens to pay different improvements, buildings, actions or vehicles.
For example when getting into a new Era that comes with new trains you are allowed to buy those with spending coal tokens, they then also need and consume coal tokens to move on your railway.
Later in other eras/ages you get new ones that then consume other resources. Sometimes a new wagon needs you to pay with wood aswell as coal and money, or a new locomotive that runs with oil needs you to have a steady income from oiltransports.
This is basically simple, but works like a charm. 
Mashinky kind of combines several games together.

If you know Ticket to Ride, Settlers of Catan and Transport Tycoon, then you have various mechanics of those mixed together in Mashinky. The token-system basically works like getting resources as in Settlers of Catan, to spend those building or buying something new. Including station upgrades.

Another interesting feature is the camera change between building (Transport Tycoon-View) and scenery.
Further building your railway network is on one hand very well done, on the other a bit clumsy at times, because you can only build one lane per square. Not a big problem, especially when looking at Mashinky more as a real-time Boardgame rather than only a successor to Transport Tycoon.

It is rather that, which has the potential to become a very social game later with multiplayer.
But even now there is enough content to allow a few dozen hours playtime and different approaches. Its a deep game already, with a lot to do and working design. Something i cant say about its competitors that even sometimes fail at basic mechanics of the genre.
Mashinky not only successfully makes them work, but also developed them further into something special.

This game is not your generic transporting game, its a special transporting game with boardgame influences that improve the formula. If you want to get a nice game of this genre and so a bit of fresh air and a new interpretation, give Mashinky a go. I cant find anything negative about it other than it is still not finished.

I also avoid early access on principle. Rarely is an early access game ""good"" when it launches. Instead, they usually require a significant amount of polish to get to a playable state.

Mashinsky, in a nice turn of events, bucks this stereotype, bringing both something new to the genre, but keeping close enough to the roots to be familiar.

Tokens differentiate Mashinsky from the usual rail tycoon games. Instead of simply buying everything you need and needing to maintain cash flow, the game introduces tokens representing different materials, and adds more as time progresses. These are used for construction of nicer wagons, better trains, and add-ons to your station or other buildings. You gain them through successfully chaining together supply lines, and each successive token requires more or different materials to craft.

This shifts Mashinsky's focus from optimizing cash flow to the delicious puzzle of building new lines and stations as new structures are added to the map. The new buildings are added procedurally - if you're lucky, one of them will appear near a station you've already built; if not, you'll spend time re-routing your network, hoping that the precious house of cards you built doesn't come crashing down as your trains gridlock.

Eventually, this becomes the core gameplay loop, as you constantly build and rebuild as your increasingly aging fleet props up your economy and you scramble to support the hottest new thing on the map. Inevitably, though, you'll make a mistake: trains might collide or everything grinds to a halt because you built a train too long for a station and it blocks the engine of your empire.

And herein lies the beauty - on the surface this is like OpenTTD, but pulling back the covers, it resembles Factorio more, a puzzle to be solved. Money quickly ceases to be a constraint, but the more complex resources never seem to generate as quickly as you want them to. Your main limitation, then, is space.

Gone are the turns in three squares. Bridges require three squares on either side of the track to be built, and tunnels require height differences that you may need to manufacture for a significant chunk of change, which you may not have. Suddenly, a change in your network might require a train to travel halfway across the map to turn around, and you don't have the space to build a turnaround. Meanwhile, it's blocking signals left and right as it strays from its intended destination.

If space is the constraint, signals are your marker to partition that space into increasingly-cramped blocks. Following logic set out over more than a hundred years of train history, you can partition your rails into blocks that trains occupy, with signals preventing another train from entering a block. This sounds trivial in theory, but in practice, as you add additional lines, passing lanes, depots, and turnarounds, they quickly become both a hated and loved tool. Gone are the lovely path signals of OpenTTD, in Mashinsky, you have to keep in mind that the entirety of an intersection might be blocked by a single train, reminding me of Factorio, again.

And much like Factorio, you can ride your trains, but unlike Factorio, you get a first-person view, able to see the rolling fields and burgeoning industry of your map as it grows. While the developer intends to add driving the trains at a later date, right now it's just a nice way to kick back and watch the machine of industry turn.

Pure beauty of old but good Tycoon 1990, made in new form with nice graphics. This is something I was looking for long time. A lot of dfferent games failed short, not having this climate and soul of old brillant tycoon.
It needs more updates of course, with more content, but this is already very playable, with some good replayability. Building empire is always different, cuz depending on player imagination. As far, they placed 4 era's, from 7.
Also, variety of maps is not big yet. I mean, there is random generation, which is ok, but biggest map is 512x512 (not so big if you like huge empires) and set of tiles types is not very differentiated. Only grass and trees, and some of buildings.

Graphics and views
3D models are in game, possible to be viewed in real time, from close range. Like view from train, view from any building, view from station etc. It gives feeling of being in countryside. This is charming.

Music
Music in this game is ideal. Chilling and with nice pace. Its even similar to old tycoon in term of tempo and instrumantation.
if you close eyes, you can feel it ;)

Gameplay
From economic point of view, it is rather chilling, not challenging. Nice, slow pace of steady grow with rail network and trains. Not punishing player for making mistakes, such as building and destroying much of rails etc. So, building and constructing in this game, is biggest plus.
Economy is steady. In old tycoon there was two modes, steady and fluctuated economy. I hated this fluctuated because factories were closing and moving. This one, have set up steady economy.
Cities are static, without growing and expanding. They are same all the time, and not growing aroung with new roads/buildings. Cities should expand as game progress, but not. I still hope they will add this into the game at some point.

Interface
There is building mode, and gameplay mode, which differs how world is shown. Building mode is very clear, with tilesets, showing with transparency how tack are laid, and how trains are movings. Much more visible for routes, and planning tracks. And it can be used as actual gameplay. You can play in building mode long time, as actual game, in real time, seeing all details of moving trains, semaphores etc. Visual mode, is just showing world in 3D perpective with all details as it should be, trees, grass, buildings, and all beuty of countryside.
This is really good combination, giving smooth and easy switch between those modes any time.

Overall
Not all content is yet there. Missing few era's of trains. Not too many updates for stations yet, just few.
Gameplay is rather not challenge. More construction, in creative way, and slow grind of money.
Visuals are good, music is very good. Interface is clear and very well done.
Missing more challenge, like competitions, and more variety of maps, and more variety of choices.
Missing also other types of transportations (as it was in tycoon, bus, place and boat). Maybe they will add, since possiblity of building roads is there already.
For easy and fun gameplay it is perfect. But for players which like challenge, it is not there yet.

A few comments about the current (early access) release:
Dollars quickly become worthless, making the economy a bit screwy. Passengers and mail don't care where you take them to, so there's no incentive to have long distance passenger lines, everyone just goes back and forth between the two nearest stations. The option to have trains reverse slowly instead of magically flipping direction seems like it could be interesting, but automatic route finding doesn't seem to use nearby sidings or loops to turn around and manually scheduling trains to go via a specific point to get them to turn around is a bit of a nuisance. In some ways though my biggest quibble is a sense of scale; complex intersections or multiple platform stations end up significantly larger than the biggest cities, sometimes there's just not enough space to fit them in which can be frustrating.

Hopefully some of these issues can be addressed before release.",1536218847,1536218847

As this is an alpha, I'd like to give some feedback of what bothered me the most (in hope for priorization):
1. When I try to place the extension ""Product storage"" of a ""Toolwork"" factory, the game crashes. Selecting the extension works, the game crashes as soon as I click the left mouse button to place the extension on the map.
2. To me, the signals feel a bit dodgy. I'm used to the principle of main and chain signals from Factorio. In Mashinky, chain signals are green if any of the next signals are green. In Factorio chain signals are only green if all of the next signals are green (track switches...), otherwise it's blue (unless all of the next signals are red, which results in red). Blue state is interpreted as red for trains going to the direction of a red signal and green otherwise. This allows to keep even crazy intersections unblocked.
3. The quest ""Go postal"" popped up, but I couldn't find no post office (saw on youtube that there should be towns with post offices for this). Maybe I'm doing something wrong here?

To be fair, it is an early access game in alpha -- but I worry the direction won't change.

I feel like there's some serious problems with how resources are shuffled around.  

Complete lack of simulation means you can just load up all waiting passengers and dump them at the nearest city.  They don't care where they're going.   Same thing for mail. 

Then other types of resources are very strange as well.   There almost seems to be no point in the gameplay loop and you become quickly disillusioned with the hampster wheel you're on.   

The best part about the game is just ""solving"" the puzzle of how to efficiently shuffle things around with your trains.  That alone is pretty fun, but the economy and resource system leaves it feeling like a game mode without any challenge -- sort of like a sandbox experience. 

I'll recommend it but only if you like puzzles and have tolerance for a lot of tedious trial and error.",1535191840,1535191840

I'm not gonna talk about the game contents, but rather about its early access status. You can see a lot of other comments about what features it contains, what it's missing, etc. in other reviews and on the community forums.

Mashinky is being made by a single developer Jan Zelený (with a bit of outsourcing). He left his primary job to be able to work on Mashinky full-time. He started it as a hobby project when working in a large game studio, but his passion, and also the success of Mashinky's Early Access release on Steam, won :) Mashinky is a prime example of what games Early Access was made for: the game would very likely not ever be released, if it weren't for Early Access. (It's NOT one of those games where large studios want to get some extra money to fund a release of unfinished games, which Early Access is sometimes abused for.)

When considering the purchase, please bear in mind that you're paying for more than just the current state of things. When I purchased it, I finished the then-current contents within a few hours. Yes, the game is not yet complete, it contains bugs (which the developer is fixing, in cooperation with the players), and it's changing quite rapidly. That's exactly the point of the Early Access programmer however. When buying Early Access games, you're a precisely defined set of features and contents. You're buying some (often small) part of what the game is going to be, then the developer's promise that it will be complete, and their idea of what the game is going to be like. There are a lot of unknowns in Early Access games, and there's really no guarantee of the outcome.

I have always liked tycoon games, be it railways or rollercoasters. The classics are long gone even though you can relive the nostalgia by replaying these games on Steam and GOG. There have been released games in the later time in the same genre with mixed reviews. I wrote a positive review about Railway empire and played Transport fever lately. I have to eat my words because Railway empire did not become what I expected it to be. Yes, graphics are good and the music appealing. But still. The magic is long gone after some hours of play. Transport fever is a good game, no doubt about that. I thought the train had left the platform after these games. But then I stumbled upon this game. Mashinky. When I read the name first time I was sure it some of these low budget bad games. I had it on my wishlist on Steam for a long time and I was like meh... Man I was wrong! 

After watching Quill18 play it on YouTube I watched many videos before I bought it. I am not disappointed at all. The graphics are nice. Not in Railway empire class but still nice to see. And I get to do what I like most, namely create routes and manage my trains, supplies and so on. This game is a must buy. Read below why I claim so.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
The controls are intuitive and if you have played RTS or management games you quickly learn the shortcuts. A short tutorial guides you through important mechanics and there you go. The menus are simple and greyish but give you the information you need. No annoying popups but straight to the point. Press ""SPACE"" and you get into the construction mode where everything is within a grid. Want to lower terrain? Raise or flatten? Very simple icons tell you what to do. You zoom in and out with the mouse wheel and navigate right-left-up-down by right clicking and move the mouse to the direction you want. The placement of tracks is an easy task if you use the grid as it is supposed to inform you about the terrain. The chain of Resource flow is mostly intuitive. For a final product to be produced resources need to be transported. For saw mills to be effective you need to get lumber from forestries. One train picks up the good and transfer it to a saw mill. The saw mill produces planks which tools industry need alongside coal. Only your imagination is the limit when laying the tracks. And some common sense. 

You can upgrade your trains as you like. Just make sure not to delete the chain already in place. The Clue is to add the new engine or carriages and then delete the former ones. You can also sell the older engines and carriages. 

As I wrote the menus are simple and there is no mambo jambo. It so simple that you of pure habit from AAA titles search for the complexity. And still it is right in front of you. The shortcuts for the keyboard are easy to learn and the information text is highlighted in yellow. I did though miss easy hints about mechanics through the game but in my case I used the forum and Google to search for answers. After all this is what made me more interested in the game because I learn to search for answers. The feeling when you finally understand is rewarding. At least for me. 

Although you have every information of use in the menus it is not always intuitive where to find it. I miss a bar like thing on the top of the screen where you can simply choose the various routes and so on. Pretty much like the information bar in Surviving Mars. 

[b]Graphics:[/b]
When I first started the game I tried a test game and the graphics were not appealing. So boring I thought. Then I explored more. I found out that after pressing ""New game"" you can choose the graphical settings for the map. They go from low to high and on highest the graphic is just WOW. After tweaking graphical settings from the main menu and put evertyhing on the highest setting I have to say that it competes with many well-known games from developers with higher budgets. The trains are so realistic and cool to look at. Graphics are not necessary everything and this game proves that. 

What I miss are options to choose the weather seasons. In the game it is rather dynamic and change between the four seasons, winter-spring-summer-autumn. It is pretty nice to see when the landscape get covered by snow. One challenge I encountered was when I was in construction mode and were trying to terraform on green soil and the weather changed to winter. Suddenly everything became white and made my task harder. I could not see so much and had to wait for spring. An option where you can choose summer all time or awitch to dynamic seasons would be nice. Like the option in Cities: Skylines where you choose to eable the day-night schedule.

[b]Sound:[/b]
There is already music in the game but it can be a little repetitive. After exploring the music folder I discovered that the music file format is .ogg. Very good for me because I have a ton of tracks from mods I created for Europa Universalis 4, Crusader Kings and Stellaris. A simple copy of those tracks into the Mashinky music folder got me a ton of music in game. We are talking about nearly 500 music tracks in .ogg format. I am playing the soundtrack for Victoria 2 in the game at this moment. 

In my opinion the music player can be developed further. I miss options such as shuffling and repeating of tracks (repeat one time, repeat all). I also miss the option to simply click on a track and start listen to it. Right now I have to click the ""previous"" button. In a list of over 100 songs it can be rather tiresome if you have to click previous to listen to a track.

[b]Verdict:[/b]
The game is being developed by one developer and it is in early access. As you can read in the Mashinky forum on Steam the developer is continually in contact with the players and regularly updates and patches the game. He regularly informs about changes to come and seems to be interested in what the community feels about the game. He seems open to new ideas and acts humble. 

This game can become the cult game we longed for in the world of corporations where only money talks and everything else is of no value. This is what I say is going back to the roots. The talent is there but in the world of powerful developers many cannot compete. This game does. It does not promise anything else than fun and fun is what I get. It will also get modding support but for me the main selling point was the option to be able to add my own music. With this opportunity the game feels more private and mine if you see where I am coming from.

There are some negative reviews about this game on Steam. Just ignore these because they do not supplement with anything of use. This game is being developed by one person. It takes time and the game is getting better with every new update. Well dont completely reject negative reviews because they pinpoint some missing mechanics in the game. But I see that the developer is aware about these missing links and is trying to implement them if he find these valuable.

This review is not a glorifying one. Yes, the game needs more content and overhaul. But the developer is constantly in touch with the community, shares ideas and listens to suggestions. This is for me a good sign. I rarely buy games in early access but this one is an exception along with They are billions. I believe in the developer and I appraise people who use their talent and try to create something on their own. The world needs entrepreneurs.

Do I recommend it? A 110% YES!

I enjoy the quests like where a church burns down or something, as well as laying track and switches, etc.  I am looking forward to this game developing more because the end game is a little lacking, but we're still in Alpha.  As an alpha it's fantastic.  Even so, once you get the money machine rolling, you just go afk for a few minutes and boom, sandbox mode engaged.

The important thing to understand about Mashinky is that is it in early stages of it's development (after several years). It is possible to enjoy the game though many promised features appear to be missing. There are currently no rival companies to be held in check or stock economy to worry about. Players who expect a deep economy complete with obscure industries may be disappointed. It is hard to call the game barebones but it is also hard to call it very fleshed out.

The real question I had before I bought it (and I spent several months wondering) was would I support further development? I can now say I would without a doubt.

Even with the current features the game already shows massive amounts of replayability and countless hours of the happy, meticulous scuplting of a railway empire. The maps are procedurely generated, though remained fixed in size, and ensure that no two play throughs and no two management strategies will ever be quite the same. I was at first quite confused with learning how to block and segment track (which was not a requirement in Railroad Tycoon 3, my usual comparison). Trains will crash into each other without proper planning and will often block eachother making track planning an essential learning experience. Some players may not like the attention to detail required to ensure every train has a path that it can follow autonomously without having to manually tell trains to turn around. In short, it is next to impossible to simply run a spur out to a new industry and expect everthing to continue running smoothly. It can actually be a welcome change of pace from the aggressive land grab found in RRT3.

While just a skeleton or a framework of a game, it is quite plain to see that the finished product will be nothing short of amazing, whenever it is released. Easily the happiest I've ever been supporting an early access title.",1530243098,1530243098
76561198124557973,598960,True,2,0,0,2735,475,121,20,"Mashinky is like model trains, but less expensive, doesn't require a whole room, and you don't have to spend hours decorating the table. The visuals are charming, many of the mechanics are clear and easy to learn. My only complaint would be that the signal system is a bit opaque, some sort of visual lens or filter to show the way the signals divide the track would be helpful.

Addendum (19 November, 2019)
After a couple dozen more hours on Mashinky, I would like to make some small changes to the review, as well as add a more concrete, numerical rating to its aspects.
Updates and experience have made signaling much easier to understand, and there are many guides both on Steam and the internet to help further this understanding. The new ages, engines, and resources that have been added are all wonderful and beautiful, with the new resources requiring real thought to be given to their supply chains. This has long been one of my go to games for relaxation, and I can only see it getting better with more additions and time. Among my few complaints at this time is that the new road vehicle system feels a bit forced, mostly as it uses the same depot as the locomotives, along with a still somewhat small collection of vehicles, but I am sure this will improve with further updates, as it is by far the newest system in the game.

Final Score:

Gameplay: 9/10 usually pretty engaging and fun, but depending on what you're doing, can get very intensive and micromanagement heavy.

Graphics: 10/10 Simply charming, not always the most detailed models of any game, but the appearance of vehicles and the surrounding landscape is most of the time a beautiful and stunning one.

Sound: 8.5/10 Composite of Music and FX

Music: 7/10 The music isn't anything too special or memorable, but it's certainly pleasant.

FX: 10/10 Trains sound excellent, with most if not all of them having unique horns and other such sounds.

Story: N/A Doesn't really apply as of writing this review.

Multiplayer: N/A Doesn't exist, so no rating.

Overall: 9.05/10 A joy to play, has been the source of several afternoons of relaxation or optimization.

Most of the techniques i remember still work, and my train system works flawlessly. Only thing i felt missing is that unlike TTD, trains can't make 45 degree turns, so you need a lot more space, like maybe a real train would need.. 

As an Early Access title, there are only a few train types, limited missions, and overall it felt like a framework of a full game, rather than anything complete.

But sadly, with only one developer, this game is going to be a very long time in the making. It's just about OK at the moment with a few annoying quirks but be warned that the dev is not allowing much in the way of tailoring the gameplay to suit more casual players. Just getting enough resources to keep things running can drive you mad while at the same time, not overstocking stations too much so they won't accept any more which prevents you earning any more resources to keep things running. Earning enough resources to get to the next era and get better trains often means you already have loads of earlier era trains running on the lines which cannot be upgraded easily.

The ONLY real nice touch is the ability to ride the trains in first person as the driver or as a passenger. The terrain in first person view is fantastic, it's a shame that as much work has not been put into the game itself. The dev is currently working on a world editor as I write this which has taken months to create when a lot of content is needed for the game, later eras with bullet trains and maybe maglev trains etc. It makes sense to me to have the content available before you worry about editing the world it runs on.

I would give it 5/10. Needs a lot of work to make it really playable and also needs a lot of options to tailor it to the preference of players playstyles. Has a lot of potential but it's going to be a very long time getting there.

First of all the game has a great rail building system, once You figure out the basics You'll be creating some really advanced rail systems and big multiplatform stations. When designing this every detail is improtant, junctions, direction of travel, planning train routes. One mistake and your carefully designed system is in trouble. Sometimes I just enjoy watching all this work instead of building more, it feels rewarding to look at a rail system You just built as it works exactly as You planned it. 
There's a variety of trains to chose from, each has a different speed, weight limit, uses different fuel type and so on. One of the challenges is to pick the right train for the right job. Going for the biggest most powerful train is not always the answer.
The economy system is simple, the variety of cargo is still pretty small yet it still allows to build some big rail systems. You are required to connect resources together in order to manufacture more items or different fuel types. It allows to really play around with the map and create something awesome.
Graphics are nice, it's not a triple A but looks nice. One nice feature is the ability to use a train camera. Choose any train You want and see the trip from inside the train. 
Overall the game is great, the fun really starts once You learned the basics. The economy is simple to manage, making money and taking care of fuel is a simple task. The best aspect is the rail building system, requires attention to detail, planning and it feels really rewarding to master.

1. A more defined sandbox mode (having everything unlocked, unlimited money, with proper terrain.

3.The depots are very picky as I saw that if 2 train lines share a platform one of the depots will not allow the train to leave.

To date, I have not yet managed to get diesel engines on my layout(s). I keep restarting after discovering new ways to streamline the layout.

I managed to find a section of a map that allowed me to create a self-sufficient loop and fit 12-15 engines/wagons all running about collecting/delivering. After cranking up the game speed to maximum it was almost like watching fish in an aquarium: the fluidity with which all the pieces moved around was kind of hypnotic. Stopping at signals, moving between other trains, entering and leaving stations.

It will be quite fascinating to watch once the promised updates arrive: electric trains, maglev, etc.  I am not a programmer so I am assuming that it is more to do with resources than technical ability but I would prefer that the tracks could be placed closer together, ie., the map 'grid' squares to be smaller but I would guess that this would put more of a strain on the graphic/processing abilities of the user's kit.

I have to recommend it as value for money even at this 'early-access' stage. There has been an occasional crash but, with the game auto-saving every minute it is far from being a problem.  When you get down to 'driver' view it is very pretty indeed.  The overhead (god) view when not in construction mode makes the trains a bit too simple to view with all the other map details involved, and it would be nice to be able to view the entire layout in some simplistic form - maybe like a London Underground map with the trains on them - so as to mimic the kind of layout one might see at a model train exhibition but, overall, well worth the money!",1519203352,1519203422

Good Thing 1

It's like OpenTTD, but with actual progression and objectives.

What I mean by that, is that instead of simply needing money, pretty much everything but the basic trains require tokens. money is also considered tokens, but I am going to ignore that. 
Now tokens can be summarized to ""global recourses"". 
For example. one of the more advanced steam trains costs ""coal tokens"" to buy and to pay for maintenance. 
This require you to have set up a coal transport line. But before you have that, you must have a passenger transport line since, that makes the money you need in order to run the coal line.
In every other transport tycoon I know of. You only need money. 
So once you have found the most profitable way to make money, you have no real reason no to do that all the time (For example the OP Planes in OpenTTD). 
Goods were always an optional thing to transport and would maybe help town growth. 
But here, there is a natural progression from passenger transport, to more and more complex goods that require more and more factories to be produced. Since you need the goods in order to build better stuff, you are naturally encouraged to produce these more and more complex goods.. It reminds me a lot of factorio (Which is a good thing).

Good thing 2: You can modularly upgrade stations and industries. I enjoy this mechanic very much.

Good Thing 3: The game is good looking. While not as great as transport fever it is still a pleasant view for the eye.

Good Thing 4: The game also heavily incentivizes complex rail networks through a variety of mechanics I can't quite put my finger on. 


This game's biggest Cons compared to other transport games:

1
Its Early Access. So, the early diesel age is the limit for now, and a lot of content in the form of trains and recourses are missing.
2
Only two types of signals (Block and basic chain), also no fast signal placement as far as i am aware of.
3
Bridges and tunnels are very rigid like OpenTTD, (So only 100 % straight bridges/tunnels, no signals on them either)
4.
Very simple auto train orders, stop at station/full load/unload all, that is all. 
5.
No clone train button, unless I am mistaking.
6.
No route function/No Easy way to change a series of trains' orders/No Easy way add tons of trains to a route/No Easy way to Replace tons of trains with a different set of wagons/locomotives ect.
7.
No multiplayer or A.I. for multiple companies.
8. 
Only trains, other modes of transportation is ""planned""
9.
No steam workshop
10.
Passengers don't have destinations. Like in for example transport fever, because of this all passengers exits the train at the first valid station.

All in all i highly recommend this game for any transport tycoon or resource management fan. And while there are far more negative points than positive ones in this review, that is simply due to them being minor features that are important, but not integral to a good experience (AKA, Quality of Life). And there is a good chance most these negative points will be made outdated through updates or modding. (Since they are so ""minor"")

It's not complicated.  In fact, it's quite simplistic in its approach and impressively intuitive in introducing new players to the game's world.  An added bonus, in my most humble opinion, is the game's music.  Refering back to Transport Tycoon, the music in that game compared to the music in this game are right on par with each other.  The in-game music is relaxing and sets the tone for the game world.  Very nice!  Another added bonus, you actually get to ""ride along"" on your creation.  I'm a grumpy old gamer and this is a bit of a novel idea.  Not that it's completely new, mind you, but rather a welcome addition to THIS type of transport game.

Train signals aren't that hard.  Factorio's signaling and pathfinding for instance is much more intuitive and functional - and it's not even a ""train game"".

To whom it may concern:
This stage after seven years of development? Mmmhh.. well, I should return to my no-early-access-policy. I mean, its a huge effort for a single person to get this far and the developer, Jan, has got my greatest respect for that, consider myself bowing low to him. But a) its a mere remake of a classic theme, b) its lacking content and depth to be a lasting game experience at this stage. c) it may well be the content in his application portfolio for a job with a major company in the near future, and we all know too well what that means for future development.

Some thoughts about game details (what comes to mind right now):
- the real mode looks up-to-date and pretty (besides the constant flickering due to heavy moire patterns in the distance) and for sure took a great amount of the development time. It may be relaxing for some ppl to follow the trains through the great landscape, but its otherwise useless. You'll spent most of the time, if not all of it, in the construction mode. I see the (developer's) advantage for splitting those two modes, but with regards to the game experience I'm not sure if that's a successful decision.
- track building is easy and path finding is fantastic, though some tougher heights and rivers could spice it up a little (an Undo-button would be great).
- train building does what it has to do without making it a new or better experience than with other games of this kind. Some clarification about weight/length numbers and more feedback to the user about penalties, if any, is urgently needed.
- signal handling is easy to use, but lacking the depth of competitors, which is (for me) not necessarily a bad thing. Its a design decision: realism of a simulation or the user friendly handling of a satisfying game.
- the german localization has lots of cringy spelling mistakes in it and is incomplete.

I dont want to tear it apart at this point, its well on its way actually, but dont expect a game at this stage that keeps you motivated for more than a couple of hours, because after 2 or 3 hours you've seen it all and understand how things work.

I have tried many different games of this type and OTTD is the only one that I have played a lot because it concentrated on building railroads and allows you to build almost any creasy design that you can come up with.

This game visually is the better version of OTTD, it is based on the same title building system which is quite flexible. Unfortunately, for now, there is not that much content in it, but it is already possible and enjoyable to build railroad systems of different complexity.

Apart from minor graphical blips in build mode (that don't affect gameplay at all), there are almost no bugs that impact the game.

The split between build mode and regular view is a fantastic idea, and it's implemented flawlessly within the game. Many retro game fans will feel right at home with the isometric and blocky terrain and easy-to-distinguish features while building, then swap over to regular view to enjoy the scenery.

Gameplay is simple, yet complex. Transport passengers for money, use money to invest in businesses and transport goods, then use higher-tier goods to upgrade your railways, stations, and buy new trains. Working with multiple different types of ""currency"" keeps the game fresh and exciting, and advancing through the eras feels rewarding. Stations have modules to increase certain things like cargo capacity, station size, and even addons like a restaurant to keep passengers happy and earn extra cash. Factories also have upgrades that can increase output, improve conversion rates on certain goods, and even accept further raw resources to produce better output.

There are little objectives and missions that pop up every so often, urging you to deliver a certain type of goods or complete a simple task, rewarding you with currency, materials, or even one-of-a-kind upgraded trains later on.

And of course, adding the ability to ride in your trains or carriages is enough to make even the manlist man squeal with glee...

So far it's an early build, and it's apparent. But just the two eras in the game already have provided me with 20 hours of non-stop enjoyment, and regular updates and progress reports from the devs are a good sign of the dedication to the game.

I can't wait to see more.",1514613814,1514613814

I like the art design of the trains and buildings in the game and up close it reminds me of something of a light-hearted 'gothic', or perhapse similar to what you would expect a steampunk game to look like. The depth of economy is there pretty well. There are lots of industries to connect together to earn economy ""tokens"" to use to upgrade factories and towns, and new industries are presented over the eras as new technologies become available. Overall I liked the originality put into the game, especially with being able to swap to a grid construction mode, then swap back to the eye candy mode, which impressed me with it being an Early Access title.

The reason I am not recommending it is because of the AI pathfinding and signaling/switching. Maybe it's because I am used to the Train Fever and Transport Fever game mechanics, but getting trains to go where you want and to use the track you want is a freaking nightmare in this game. Even a track that only has one train on it can still get lost if the layout is even remotely complex in design (due to strategy of connecting industries/towns, etc). I tried everything I could think of using signaling and passings and nothing I did worked, and this is comming from someone who has designed lines on Transport Fever that serviced 20+ trains from multiple lines on a single complex corridor layout on the side of a cliff! I was really proud of that one >:D  I don't claim to be a signaling genius, but if I can't do it, the 'average joe' or 'casual gamer' who has little experience with rail tycoons and layout of track logistics will be pulling their hair out from the roots.

In short, this game is original and inventive, but it is too frustrating to work with and the AI makes Kim Jung Un look like a holy messiah in terms of brain power. Although this game actually had economical features that I wished were in Transport Fever, the latter is a ---FAR--- better game for rail tycoon enthusiasts. It's a shame too, because as I stated earlier, I actually liked this game, but the problem with it is in the core of the game design, not something I expect the Developer to be able to ""patch"" better in the coming future.

In game detail is wonderful, with an amazing map, and an equally as impressive construction map, all quests and tasks are well thought out and generally easy to understand and complete.
Pros:- I enjoy this games factory/industry layout and the ability to transfer shipments at stations in stead of a 'one train-one shipment' style of other games. 
Cons:- The game is still early access atm, so its not a massive drama, though do be careful on a few of the quests that allow you to 'ride in your train' these quests can sometimes crash the game.

As for the overall play through, geberal mechanics, art style, and the general player absorbtion into the game I would give this game a healthy 3.8 out of 5. This game will most definitely get better as its finished, definitely worth jumping 'on board' XD .

The guide and online manual demonstrates some very unique solutions to routing trains into stations. This link details how to set the signals for various intersections: https://mashinky.com/wiki/index.php?title=Junctions . I now really enjoy learning how to master the setting of signals and block control for train routing (deterministic vs. automatic routing). This is a much better replacement of SM Railroads (automatic routing). Highly detailed items, great graphics. Currently, there are only a few resources: passengers, loggs, lumber, coal, and iron. Iron (iron mines) does not appear until you get to the Steam Age. The new upgrade will add three more resources and new resource buildings and unlock perks. Resources must be delivered to thier appropriate industry production buildings to gain new refined resources and products. Very stable game. Occasional crashed on in-game reloads. Many buiding extensions are available to increase revenue and other resources. A guide on developing resources is in the online manual. Train car consists must be changed at the depot (realistic). Car consists can't be changed at stops. It seems this is done for realism, otherwise, how would the empties get back?. There is a Sell button to delete/remove cars/engines when at the depot.

The business aspect of the game is so simplified that it's just not interesting. Cargo and passengers can be delivered wherever you want. They just don't have any specific destinations and it there is no requirement to build proper lines with multiple stations for example when it comes down to passenger transport.

I built a simple line between three cities and the train always dropped of everyone at every single station. That tells me that there is nothing behind the passengers other than ""Produce x amount of passengers at station"". So basically - take two cities that are far away and transport passengers between them => massive profit. I expect more from a business simulation in the current year.

Also the UI is rather weak at the moment, but I think this will probably be optimized in the future.

- You cannot upgrade a train engine without completely rebuilding the trains route.

Even in early access, there are already so many things to do, even on a small map (haven't even yet tried a large map). Of course, some functions could be improved on. I miss for example the option to move buildings which makes it quite expensive if, for example, you extended your train depot. In general though, this is a beautiful game for everyone who fondly remembers building kilometers/miles of track in Chris Sawyers games of old. Especially the first person view is something I can't get enough of.

*suggested improvements*
- Pathfinder algorithm like in OpenTTD. My trains now get too easily gridlocked on intersections.
- Ability to move your own buildings.
- More clearly tutorial about which goods are accepted where. A lot of crates are now waiting in my workshop without a seemingly valid target.",1511029411,1511029411

The graphics are especially nice, giving off a sort of early 2000s-era vibe that RT3 had in spades. The use of tokens instead of actual cash is an interesting idea, making use of a system that most transportation games don't bother trying.

There are still some clunky bits here and there however. Things like altering a train's orders takes way too many button clicks. However the most egregious error so far is the game's lack of...PATH SIGNALS.
What does this mean? It basically means that this game suffers from the major flaw that Chris Sawyer's Locomotion suffers from; even if two trains' paths don't cross at all, if they share a signal block, they'll stop anyway. This one fault adds a bit of frustration to the game that shouldn't be there when OpenTTD and Transport Fever already have path signals.

What's even worse is train pathfinding. There are many instances when a train will take a path and refuse to change it, resulting in manual deadlock.

Regardless, Mashinky is a decent title for an alpha 7 years in the making. Whether or not you wait for a price drop depends on how much of a fan of these kinds of games you are. The game is still in development though, so sooner or later my qualms will probably be fixed. We'll just have to wait and see.",1510726542,1542849754

Not only won't you get a warning, but the lost train always manages to screw up your other routes by reversing and or jaming up what are meant to be single traffic lane.

NEXT UPGRADE needed : Better artificial intelligence of trains. Even if a signal is green, a train should know that proceeding will leed it on the wrong course.

NEXT UPGRAGE #2 : Being able to put double/triple locomotives on a convoi and to being able replace them without going to the depot!

Despite the sequels and copycats (some more decent than others) that have been introduced over the years, I never thought I would ever encounter a game like it... until now. Mashinky successfully pairs that same level of simplicity with the beauty of modern graphics while giving the gameplay new elements that add more interesting challenges.

Pros:
- I like the ability to switch between the simplified isometric look for building and the more detailed look for just enjoying the view.

- The complex, yet easy to understand ""resource tree"" makes setting up routes to convert raw materials to tokens an interesting exercise in logistics and problem solving.

- The procedurally generated maps always guarentee a different experiance with each new game.

Cons:
- I actually missed the Trains having to reverse out of stations as it was more realistic and did necessitate more elaborate track plans and orders, it would be nice to retain that feature as an option.

- Some Structures, trains, and extensions seem overly expensive given the slow rate of production for some tokens especially when certain challenges have a time limit.

- While a minor nitpick, the placement of some key resources and structures can often be frustrating when you have limited resources and have to reach across almost the length of the whole map. When new ages are unlocked, the new resource buildings tend to spawn in rather inconvienent places, one example was a post office spawning way outside of the city beyond the reach of the fully extended station I had already built there.

Perhaps the roads can play a part in connecting resource buildings to cities like if the ""town hall"" and a resource building are connected by road tiles, then the station with the ""town hall"" within it's range would have access to it, this would seem more realistic and make it important for players to build more roads.

2. The early industries are a great way to start

I spended around 29 hours when they released the first ver ( 2 era ) and then I stopped and continue playing when I heard 3rd era was out. 

Pro
1) Its a train sim tycoon. It is not like we drive a ready made train on a ready made rail. NO. We build it and we can view it in first person mode
2) Quests and challenge. There is bunches of quests and also challenge to overcome. I had 48 trains in a small map and I need to manage or else they will stuck.
3) I love how the game using checker grid when we in build mode and I can see clearly and plan ahead.

Con
1) Limited tutorial. There is no tips or balloon that show us this is token for fuel, this is token for something-something, no there is not. All you have to do is guessing. Not too mention it take me 34 hours before I realized the mails is not collected because I dont know we actually need to delivery the mails to the PO.
2) Please expect that this game is not perfect yet, my game suddenly crash for no reason and also lag when it reached 30 trains. 
3)  Maybe it just me, but I am prefer I like to have a menu that we can change unit, for example mile to km. Not a big problem

• beautiful graphics
• you can switch between build and view mode
• entertaining jazz music (apart from 1 track and some repetitive parts of other tracks)
• gameplay mechanics are great
• random and scripted quests - keeps the game rolling after you've finished linear play
• nice UI touches (like water color painted menu)

↓ BAD ↓
• little game, music and other content for 23e (for 15e it would be more favorable content-wise)
• music track Grease On Rails made me turn off all sound for 5 minutes and then turn it off whenever I started to hear it
• some of the other music tracks have long parts where the music is extremely repetitive and makes me start TTD music
• not many options in game settings, when you start a map

→ NORMAL ←
• early access bugs (you don't say?)
• early access game optimization (no s h i t sherlock...)

On a (slow but) sure way to be the real and worthy successor of the best transport game of all times - Transport Tycoon (or TTD or OTTD).

The developer really liked TTD and it shows in the gameplay of Mashinky. It's seamless and makes you want to play longer and longer. Make that junction, add that industry to the chain, connect those 2 cities, oh there's another forest here that I can haul to my sawmill, etc.

Yes - as most of the negative reviews say - the game has little content if you want to play strictly in a linear way and progress quickly to the ""modern age"". Because it has just 2 out of 7 train ages. So if you play quickly, you'll end quickly. And maybe it will not be worth 23e to those playing just the linear way.

But for me it is finally a game, that is a light at the end of a long tunnel. Going from Transport Tycoon golden ages to Mashinky with similar gameplay and gorgeous graphics.

Btw, loving how many industries there will be compared to the original TTD.

GRAPHICS & CONTROLS - The graphics are really nice especially when doing a ride along on your trains. The controls are fairly easy to learn and I really like the ease of expanding and adding functions to your stations. You still have to accomplish tasks in order to add these items but I like them a lot better than the last two train sims that I have played. The passengers are utilizing the stations that I built without me having to start another trolley or wagon system internal to the town. It may get more complicated later as the towns expand.

PASSENGER, FREIGHT & CARGO -  I seem to be learning the cargo aspect of this game a whole lot easier than a couple of other train games that I never quite understood how to do. At least in this game, the freight & passengers gather at the station.  You can expand the station tracks easily (if you have money) to accommodate additional train (passenger & freight) by adding additional tracks plus it even knows that the new tracks belonged to that station & did not create a new station name (like another game has done to me). 

ENGINES & DEPOTS - You start with a couple of  early 20th century steam engines to pick from  along with some early passenger & freight cars.  I just completed a number of tasks so I was given the opportunity to expand my depot and build larger engines.

So far, the only minor issue that I have had (Windows 7-64 bit, 16 GB RAM, EVGA GTX 970) is one crash after about 3 3/4 hours.  The game saves automatically (at an interval that you set) so nothing was lost. I am not sure why one train cannot seem to find its path consistently but that could be me and not the game. I would definitely recommend the game at this point especially when I saw that the developer had just done some updates in the past week.

The graphics contain stunning mountains, lakes, trees, the houses and other buildings that have amazing detail. You have free reign of laying down the tracks to suit your map layout, it also contains bridges and tunnels that you can actually ride through on your train.

You are able to expand on the different stations as well as the industry, there are also a few upgrades to the trains. The maps to play on are different each time you start up, and having the capeability to chose to make the game hard or easy is up to you. 

This game is very relaxing with no pressures to build quickly against competition, the soundtrack is really nice the hours just fly by even though it feels like minutes of playtime.

76561197972245774,598960,True,0,0,0,240,240,298,22,"Mashinky is a one-man-team effort to capture the magic of Railroad Tycoon and other similar games. This is an impressive effort so far. At the moment this is a procedurally-generated sandbox game where you start with some cash, a map with some cities, coal mines, forests, sawmills and factories and you build your dream transportation empire from there. As you build up your network of stations, depots, etc., you get quests to complete specific tasks and unlock new locomotives, carriages, extensions for buildings and progress through different technological ages. You also have various terraforming tools to raise and lower the terrain, plant or remove trees, build tunnels, bridges and roads.

That said, this is a very early build version. It is very rough. The framerate is frequently terrible (and I'm running this on a PC which can run Witcher 3 on nearly max settings at 60 FPS with no framerate drops), it often stutters when switching from construction view to regular view, and I've experienced many hard crashes to desktop. Also, whether in full screen or window mode, the game really does not like being alt-tabbed out of. There also isn't really a tutorial at present, just a few tutorial quests to teach the bare basics, so expect to start a new game a few times to really understand how the many systems work in the game and what big differences are introduced when you advance through the ages. Also, the signals are a bit fiddly and require some trial runs as you're trying to organize your train schedules. Many features are not yet complete or work as intended but this is an early access game and the creator is very responsive to the community and quick with the updates. I'd also like to see a feature where you can toggle laying a dual track instead of a single track by default, it would safe a ton of time.

So overall, if you are a big fan of Railroad Tycoon, railroad board games (this game borrows a lot of mechanics from board games such as Age of Steam), or building intricate transportation and production networks, definitely keep an eye out for this game. Even with the crashes, stuttering framerate and some missing features, it's very addictive and already has a lot of depth. Just be aware of its rough edges.",1508696369,1508696369

Would like to see some commercial buildings in towns and cities as well.  The economy seems to work fairly well so that innovation is rewarded and inefficiency punished. In this genre, capitalising on your own failure is the greatest reward.

However, it feels like the trains' logic is a little stochastic. More than once, my trains have crashed into each other because they decided to take a silly route around when there was what seemed like a clear alternate path. Though that was easily subverted by building separate branch lines.

Overall, the board game concept is enticing and the visual style crisp. As it is, this is quite a promising tycoon game, and I can see it's going for more than just a casual approach.",1508527139,1508527139

I played Chris Sawyer's Locomotion for many years and the prospect of a potential  next generation was to much to pass.  I also welcomed the opportunity to support the developer and team who has worked many years on the project. 

I have had a few days trying out the game and it does not disappoint.  It is obvious that the devs have, like me, experienced many of the issues that made, at times, simliar ""train"" games so frustrating.  Just off the top of my head here are a few of those issues that are nicely resolved in Mashinky. 

- Clean and clear terraforming
- Quick and accurate placement of signals and their directionallity
- An arrow on the track showing both directionallity and its aspect (red or green)
- Very fluid track laying (I note the devs have opted against multiple track laying. I think it is because they have opted for a differing ""geometry"" for track that is line with the tiles as opposed to that on the diagonal, I guess one can only have clunky multiple track laying or slick single track laying)  
- As someone with impaired vision I greatly welcome the use of a clear font on a dark background. I do wish other devs would follow suit.  Thank you to Steam too.
- If you undo track, buildings, roads, etc then you get your money back.  In this sort of game as you are designing as you build then it is enevitable that you will want to ""unbuild"". Also, later gameplay often requires complete rebuilding of junctions and stations. It is just dandy to be able to do what you want without constantly watching the  money drain away.
- One of the great turnoffs in many PC games is ""The Pokemon Imperitive"". Not a Robert Ludlum book, just my term for gameplay that persistantly drives the player to greater goals and new targets.  Actually, I get quickly irritated by this and prefer to do my own thing, take a different approach, take time out to learn something, etc.   I play games to amble about  and enjoy others to strive and enjoy.  Mashinky does allow you to refuse or accept proffered goals and as I understand it it is possible to set up a game with a lot of starting tokens,  no challenges and for me a lot of fun.
- The devs have created two distinct games views - design and realistic.  The former is actually a game in itself. Then you can simply hit the space bar and go into a realisic view, ride on the trains, and this is another aspect of the game. The graphics are excellent although I do find (as a Train Sim person) that the track rendering is a bit clunky; this may be my PC as is due an upgrade.
- Unlike,in say, Locomotion, you cannot name your trains; they are simply numbered ""Train 1"" etc.  Initially I was a bit disappointed by this until I remembered the problems that naming trains actually causes. Frequently ending up with 3 trains called ""Coal to Power Station"" and getting completely confused.  
-The various menu boxes for each train, station, etc. can be resized making say a list entirely visible. 
- double clicking on virtually any name takes you to it i.e. stations, trains, etc.
- All objects have clear and concise labels - this can be turned off if required - a nice touch there. 
- A surprising and elegant idea is the addition of ""extensions"" these seem to be available on nearly all items and permit the addition of say a waiting room to a station, which costs, but increases the catchment area of the station.
- the game works in tokens for money (green), coal (black), etc.  This should make the game universally attractive.
- Another interesting concept is the splitting of passenger services from freight. The former earn money tokens the latter do not but do, in conjuction with tasks,  earn other tokens.          


Other observations
This is very much a game in development with devs very much in touch with their audience. It is good to be part of this and I look foward to the pleasure that upgrades will bring.  I really value this fairly recent approach where devs connect to those who play their games. I am sure we have all said ""if only the dev had done this to make a good game a great game. 

Currently there are some workarounds, quick and dirty fixes, etc.  This is fine with me as it is a work in progress. 

A small niggle  - I would welcome the highlight colour in the save game menu to be red or blue as I really struggle to differentiate the game that has the focus.  

Second small niggle.  Forested areas are shown in design view as I think it costs more to build in such areas. The forest footprint is generally feint but on occasions is dark enough to occlude the signalling arrows. This makes setting directionallity occasionally difficult. 

The names generated for stations appear to be only UK ones and a fairly limited range at that.  As I live in the UK then I am happy with this but I would welcome a larger database as one is always hoping to see towns appear that you know and love/hate.  Why not charge people to add a town/village name of their choice.  Hmmm, Great Snoring, Great Fryup, Barton in the Beans, Curry Mallet, Mudford Sock, Marsh Gibbon, etc.  

This is a game I have been awaiting for mny years.  Thanks devs.

As a Transport Tycoon veteran with thousand of played hours in TT, TTDLX, TTDPatch and OpenTTD, I feel home again. But this time, the game offers so much more. My review is highly based on my TT background, rather than for transport games in general. 
But it seems to be clear that Jan is also a TT guy, so that might fit. For an early access game, you can already have a lot of fun with hit. Of course you won't see the tons of possibilities that OpenTTD with tons of mods has to offer... yet.

Having waited for years to find a GOOD  sandbox railroad game, without A.I. competitive pressures and without too much complexity of operations, must say that I am delighted with what I have found so far.......

This is a fun game to fiddle and play around with.  Add a bit here, adjust the station there, reroute your connections and generally get lost in the world without noticing the time going by.  Build how and where you wish and get the satisfaction of observing your system developing in complexity. It is very  much a ""Just one more turn game"". :-))

Optional quests with financial rewards regularly pop up and give you some direction to follow if you wish to do them.  So there is a story in the background that you can follow, or you can just construct as you wish to do so.

Although the game is still very much Alpha mode at this time, it is still loads of fun to play.  I'm sure that it will just get better as the new era's get added to it.  Having said that, I think that the game is already at a level that it is fully playable at this time with lots of goodies still to come in the future.

THE GOOD:

Nice graphics.
Great idea implimented with dual graphics modes for construction and operational activity.
Good sounds and music.
Nicely produced random maps.
Great ability to catch trains and ride around as a passenger inside them.
Easy to lay track, build roads, build stations, build trains, give trains operational orders, add enhancements, alter terrain, etc.
An adjustable auto-save operation that assists you in not losing your work if things go wrong.
There is no heavy financial pressure in the game that restricts your ability to build.  I like this very much.

The Developer appears to be continuing the development of the game as promised and is taking notice of the players suggestions for the game.  However the development time appears to be quite slow as it is a one-man effort on a part-time basis.


THE NOT SO GOOD:

While there is a basic tutorial to get you going, there is no complete manual as such.  You need to rely on the community members for advice on how signals operate for example.  There are a number of activities that I had to discover by trial and error , or by having noticed a comment that someone had posted online.  Other examples of this are finding out how to enhance stations and depots, or how to build newer trains.  You are not told how to remove an older train in order to replace it with a new one.  I guess that this will overcome as development continues.

There are many bugs at this time.

I do hope to see an economic change in the future:  It is not realisric to me that the fares you earn are based on station to station delivery only and it makes no difference what the distance is between staions.  You earn the same if the passengers travel one kilometer or a thousand kilometers!

I have had one crash so far, but no damage was done as it had been auto-saved for me.



SUMMARY:

This game, when completed might fill the Railroad Tycoon void for me.  I find myself drawn into the simulation and having a great time making decisions and constructing my plans.

There are a few flaws here and there in the system that might be improved over time, but these are not major issues.

I recommend this game for players who enjoy ""building games"" and love railways.  It's a great railroad simulation and is destined to become better as it develops in the future.  I suggest if you are interested to go ahead and support this game by purchasing it.  You will get value for money with this.

6 MONTHS LATER:
Having made my review, (above), 6 months ago, I must now report that the development of this game by the solo developer hopelessly slow and nothing is progressing in any meaningful way. Because of the tardiness of the developer I have to alter my recommendation to a NO instead of the YES that I orginally gave it.  This game is effectively going nowhere.

I'm giving it a thumbs up, even though it is a thumb down for me.

I love almost everything about this game, and it will eventually be multiplayer, which is a HUGE deal that not even something like Transport Fever has, which was built from a team of developers instead of just one guy.

The breaking point for me was the isometric building view, it ruins everything for me.  The game is so beautiful, I want to stay in that view.  One of my favorite parts of these types of games is building, and I want it to look attractive when I'm building, I just cannot stand the building view when I know beauty is just a click away.  

It isn't that I mind the isometric view in other games, indeed, it does make building easier in this game, and I understand why it is done, but it really breaks immersion for me.  In Transport Fever, it always feels as if I'm building a company in another world.  When I switch to construction view here, it feels as if I'm playing a game, then when I leave construction view, I get immersed in the fictional world again, only to have to break it again by entering construction view again.

I still give this a thumb up, because I think I'm one of the few that this will bother, and it is a great game besides, with multiplayer!  That is a huge deal, but at this point, I just don't think I can get past the isometric view.",1508010228,1508679028

First warning though, it is an Alpha stage game. You can easily cover all the content in a single afternoon (which is what happened in my case) but thankfully the game tells you when you have finished it all so you don't spent hours searching for something that isn't there. 

The interface is easy to use. You have 8-10 trains engines with a slew of passenger/freight cars to choose from. A nice little economic system and some early signs of advanced strategy (which has yet to be implemented). One thing i found really neat was how the map evolves (similar to Civilization games) when a new resource is discovered. Which means you may have to redesign portions of your network to get access to it. 

My two or three cons to the game (which I'm sure will be fixed with later versions) is:

- The Switching system. There is no explanation on how to impliment it and it doesn't work like other titles I have played. 
- How short the platforms are. Even though you get access to one upgrade, adding two more sections doesn't really do much. Especially when the larger capacity cars are, well, larger in size as well so it seems better to stick with more small cars. 
- The camera movement needs a little work. I find the center mouse button for the slewing of the camera angle is kind of buggy/twitchy. 

All in all the game shows good potential and I look forward to new updates and especially Steam Workshop implimentation. I definitely recommend this game.",1508006781,1508006781

Mashinky is no clone however. It differs on key aspects, such as how supply, demand and rewards work. Full supply chains need to be completed before you are rewarded. Meanwhile these rewards come in different currencies, each of which are required to purchase different things. You can't buy every train with the default currency for instance. Another great addition is that you can upgrade stations, depots and even industries. Especially fiddling with industry upgrades is very powerful, as it allows you to modify supply chains. A couple of hours in you will realise you started out real simple and now you are mastering a complex puzzle.

Things I love:
- Station, Depot and Industry upgrades;
- All trains are usefull, you need to choose wisely;
- Because of depot updates, you want to serve multiple lines from one depot;
- It's easy to oversupply, you can't just dump everything one industry;

[h1]What is it?[/h1]

I love trains.  I love games with trains, be they simple Train Valley time management puzzles, or full blown train simulation games like Train Simulator, and I've probably played them all.  But my favourite of all has to be a railroad tycoon style game, so when I saw Mashinky, it was an immediate-buy for me.

Mashinky is, predominantly, a sandbox railway construction game, similar to others where you connect towns and transport passengers and goods.  A basic tutorial already exists, but anyone familiar with more complex sims (past and present) like Transport Tycoon and OTTD, Sid Meier's Railroads, and the Train and Transport Fever games will feel very at home.  It's a simple game to play, lacking the complexities and difficulties of more detailed titles such as Cities in Motion, but it's a title that joins up many of the good things from the games that came before it.



[h1]What's good about it?[/h1]

By far and away the best feature of this game is the absolute genius twin modes of play.  When I looked at the store screenshots, I was a little confused at first.  There were these gorgeous graphics depicting beautifully detailed trains in nicely textured terrain viewable from any angle, and then there were screens showing a rather basic top-down view of a grid-tiled green area on which you plonk down rail that can only follow the grid that you could be forgiven for thinking came from a 1990s game from the pedigree of Chris Sawyer and early Sid Meier.  And, with the ongoing success of Open Transport Tycoon Deluxe (OTTD) still being lovingly maintained by its fan base, things were starting to look a little awkward for Mashinky if the grid view was the real game.

So which one IS the real game?  BOTH!  Construction mode uses the grid view.  You lay down stations and track with signals and such in that simple top-down grid then, with a click of a button, you are back to the beautiful landscape view of your train lines in action where most of your railroad management takes place - with graphics that exceed the quality of other current transport tycoon sims.  You have camera views where you can ride the train from any car or wagon (even from inside there are basic graphics).  Even the tiniest details are incredible already.  Long, lean stripped down tree-trunks with their rough, detailed bark were loaded into my lumber wagons, and almost every part of the locomotive is animated, detailed in colour and with realistic everyday-grime texturing.  Dusty wagons collected my coal.  Trains in the distance were in soft focus until they began to take shape on their approach, with great steam effects and lovely animations.  Carriages looked old and rustic.  It is for all the world like the genius simplicity of games like OTTD with their easy grid layout being joined with games with today's much more realistic graphics and textures, giving the best of both worlds.  It is the rail tycoon that, on surface, is showing signs of one day becoming the game I've dreamed of for a very long time.

The maps are procedurally generated and the missions generated with these are classic ""deliver 200 timber to..."" for rewards of cash and a novelty reward of resources such as wood and coal that you can reinvest into your railway development.  There are no cohesive sets of missions yet (I don't know whether any are planned) but for sandbox fans it will mean that no two games will ever be the same.  Stations are expandable (platforms and buildings), you can extend the basic road network to neighbouring towns too (though this doesn't seem to have been developed beyond an aesthetic purpose right now) and you can rename your towns, buildings and rail stock.  The game will be covering many eras of locomotive up to and including modern-era locos (yes!  I missed modern era trains badly in games like Railroad Tycoon 3, so this is great news for me).

Finally, gameplay is simplicity itself.  There is a very basic tutorial already, but to be honest, anyone who has played any of the transport management sims available will be right at home already.  The user-interface is perfect, with everything being both logical and manageable (windows can be dragged around the window, menus are uncluttered and all elements of design tools obvious.  You can set up load and unload orders for trains if you wish, though there is no greater scheduling such as that found in Cities In Motion.

Overall, I felt wowed by my initial time with the game and I'm super-excited about its future after being a tad disappointed in other recent titles.



[h1]What's not so good (currently - remember that this is Early Access)[/h1]

There is no real tycoon element in terms of finance management yet.  Making profits and losses and working towards corporate goals have always been strong elements of these types of games, especially with having to meet the needs of neighbouring towns in order to be successful.  This is all at a very basic level in Mashinky right now.  The game still needs a bit of purpose behind it, with stronger win/lose conditions.  There is no competitive AI and I don't know if one is planned.  That doesn't matter to me, but might be an important issue for other players.

With no story-based missions to play through, it lacks the sense of glorious history set up in this genre's greatest ever contender: the brilliant Railroad Tycoon franchise, where in those games you felt that you were playing a piece of history in trying to achieve seeming insurmountable goals as did the forefathers of railroads of yesteryear.

The cost is a little on the high side for the content available right now, but it's clear that the work done already is simply stellar, showing great promise of things to come, so you will be buying [i]potential[/i] rather than quantity of content at the moment.

It needs people!  The goods graphics are lovely, but I want to see passengers on platforms and in carriages.  I imagine this will come in time though.

As mentioned earlier, the maps are procedurally generated.  I'm no fan of any procedurally generated game and I would much rather be given a REAL country to tackle.  I hope that the game will evolve to be able to use and import specific maps generated by players in the longer term.  Right now though, everything is random so bear this in mind before you buy because no pre-planned maps have been promised.

Right now, there are some routing issues with trains not always taking logical routes or obeying signals - to be expected this early in the game's development.  Railroads beyond a simple joining of two stations lead up to trains unable to pass each other.  I expect this is one of the areas that will see ongoing improvement because it IS early, (it's so easy to think that the game is more complete than it is given that it is SO highly polished already, so in fairness we should expect these problems).  

Finally, stability-wise, while I didn't encounter any crashes during play, the game suffers that nasty little problem of not being able to Alt-Tab out of the game or otherwise minimise the window.  Doing so is an instant frozen black-screen, the game cannot be closed via Task Manager and nothing else can be done other than a hard reboot of your PC.  I hope this bug is zapped soon.  It's a bit of a curse for anyone like me who likes to switch between my current game and other activities.


[h1]Verdict[/h1]

Mashinky is a very early-access title with a limited amount of play right now, but it is beautiful, it is fun AND it is so simple to play too.  Buy it now if you want to invest in its potential before it becomes a full (and probably more expensive) product.  However, if you want a full tycoon experience, you might want to wait to see how this element evolves.",1507892128,1510481590

Eventhough if you are going to compare to other train game, many aspects can be considered simplified, 
but yet there is enough complexity and uniqueness that sets this game apart and let you enjoy this game.

• Token system : This game plays more as resource management game rather than a realistic simulation, your basic goal would be to transport specific resource to where one of the place it is needed where you would have to decide what would be the shortest path to achieve such goal then build your route upon that
With that system in place the economy in this case is different 
1) Not everything lead to money (heck there isn't even infrastructure upkeep in this game as far as I can see) , your goal is get tokens so you can spend them making your system better.
2) There is no incentive to transport goods over certain distance just to make profit.
3) Transporting people is also different, it's simply become [People whom are wanting to get out of a town] rather than [people whom wanting to get from A to B or to C] thus there isn't incentive to actually build A->B->C->B->A route other than to maximize efficiency (giving A and C time to generate more [people] ) or to share existing infrastructure.


• Modular buidlings upgrade: You are able to upgrade your stations to specialize in loading goods or people better and faster but by default your station will be able to do both starting off
You are also able to upgrade industries for better outputs using your Token, or upgrade it to start intake some Token to further increase proficiency while not locking you out from what it was already able to do (for example you can upgrade Saw mill to have steam saw mill module that will start taking coal with wood to start producing more woods, but if you stop feeding it coals the basic sawmill will still be working)

• Isometric construction mode: Simple, seamless and elegant, adding functionality while doesn't take away from beautiful scene in normal mode should you want to snap back and enjoy the scene.
- It may take some understanding to build over rough terrain, but once you understand it, it's really simple, it is just simply that there isn't much automation in shaping terrains like in other games (yet?)

Because of these 3 points, I feel that this game is unique and enjoyable, 

at the current stage, the game offers and proves that it has a solid ground to stand on for further development it is promising. The content is far from lacking from what I feel, but certainly there are rooms for much more, and I DO want much more.

I hope for success in development and that the game will fully come into fruition, and I will be deeply disappointed should this game be abandoned, I may come back to edit this review once in few months time

There are two features of  the game that stand out to me:

The quick transition from ""realistic"" mode to ""build"" mode. The graphics in ""realistic"" mode, while somewhat stylized, are gorgeous. The graphics in build mode are crisp and easily readable and very reminiscent of Transport Tycoon Deluxe.

The abstract token economy. Passenger trains generate cash tokens. Transporting resources to different industries generates lumber, coal, and iron tokens. Station and industry upgrades and locomotives and rolling stock all cost different combinations of these tokens. New tokens like steel, electronics, and super conductors are added each time you enter a new tech era. This prevents the problem many tycoon games have where you reach a critical mass of cash income and cost is no longer a barrier, you can always buy the biggest and best tech as soon as it is available. Since you can't have stockpiled the new tokens before they are available, each new era is still an interesting expansion challenge.

The game is very early which I love like prison architect, Ark and still going strong my favorite Factorio so this is always a pull to buy for me.

The game is solid, sometimes it will crash but for the most part I believe it may have happen maybe 3 or 4 times and it seems to not handle going back from a large map full of running trains to the menu screen, for that you have to back out and close it through windows and it locks mouse so you have to manually close it. 

It is easy once you get the goals down, really don't see a failure except wanting to do a bunch of things with little tokens or money source ( sorry not sure it has a name yet but its not money ). But my main goal is to run the trains efficent as possible with little to no downtime. The controls are super easy, especially the raise and lower of the hills of which thats usually a hassle.

Trains look really nice. And of course it takes a few tries to understand the signals and rail placement. Really need block signals and a realistic turn about or round, trains reversing on there own kills the small realistic I feel in Real world view. But its a game so I get it.

I will have to say the going to between real world view and build view and to ride the trains and soon read drive them it is awesome it is one of its best feature. Build a train station, restaurant, few station blocks and trees, then give it a few seasons and its neat to come back and its a thriving town. Though the variety is lacking in style houses, there are no cars, absolutely other then running trains and trees there is no life, no people, no animals, the roads are of its own mind and make no sense when game places them. And so far I have yet to see a way to destroy a house once the game places it there.

So give it a chance, it is a little steep at $25 but for me it was trains, a glowing review from KOS, and if it grows into what I have expectations for Ill be happy. Its in early access so you have to keep that mind.

- graphics looks great
- easy to build 


Cons
- in current state it isnt worth 23 euro(too short)
- PBS signals from OpenTTD probably will not be implemented
- you have to guess length of train 
- really short stations 
- longer transport ditances doesnt reward you


This game has potential. Its graphics are really nice and I like diferent sizes of Locomotives and wagons. Economy is just bad. You are not payed for traveled distance, so shorter tracks means better which is kinda boring and easy to play and basically ruin core of transport game. Now about signals. I loved building complex train lines like in real life where there are many trains on single track, but in this game is problem, that there are no Path based signals, which make every crossing the rail slowing point. And as answer to when this will be implemented we get that it wont be, because author wants to drive trains, so those signals will be very jard to implement. Who the hell wants drive train in transport game ????? If I want it there are already amazing games like Trainz simulator. So in my opinion this is kinda waste of resources. Another thing is, the stations are too short. 6 pieces in 2. Era?? I need at least 10.

You can pretty much do all the things that are featured in other train games.  Lay track, buy and sell Engines and cars.

The layout for all this is generated each time you start a New game.  You won't see LA or Chicago because the layout is fictious.

Jumping into a train and watching scenery or other Trains chugging by is also fun.

I haven't run into any major bugs which says a lot about the Dev.  There are lots of little things that need done, mostly on the graphic side,  You have to remember this is an Early Access game so many more changes are in store for this dandy little program.

Getting used to the Signaling system is a bit troublesome at first but once you get the hang of it there isn't much you can't do with your Trains.

Perhaps a bit expensive for an Early Access game but well worth it.

Placement of resources is random so you can end up with a sawmill located many miles from any timber.  At this point your not allowed to buy or build any producers of goods.  A map editor is in the works.

Towns take only passengers.  Goods are taken to Toolwork Stations where they're turned into tokens.  Tokens are used to advance the game from Steam to Diesel etc.   Advancements can be done with the token system or you can select Time advancement.  Money is used only for buying Engines, Cars and Track.  You can't buy Tokens.  There are different types of Tokens and they can only be earned by delivering certain resources to specific station types.

The game is sandboxed enough so that you can just run passenger trains but Advancement by Time would have to be selected in Advance settings.

First yes this is early access, I know that.

First of all if you love trains you may still want to buy the game, and suport development.  But any one who is looking for game play it isnt here yet, and at this price it should be more filled out. 

I will state that it is a fun game in a small map that you will start on, then as the game time line progress spawns will take space you need to build what is needed.  This leads to rebuilding rail lines that had worked before into a mess that dosent work for the new industry spawned in at random as the time line progress's and adds more onto the map.  

Easy way to fix, mark spots that will spawn new industry dont say what they are but mark them so they can be planed for and dont clutter the map later on.

As and example of rebuilding and remaking every thing over and over I will explan your first set up.  The first thing that get's money is pasengers, and you will set up a rail line from town to town,then they add mail.  This in some towns dosen't reach the old train station as an example, the post office is placed on the other side of the town and the station wont reach it.  So to fix this run new rails and a new station then add more trains to run mail.  Adding new trains for mail ok, remaking all rails to fix this not ok.  Now just keep doing that same thing every time you get a new era, not fun real fast.

  Then there is no way to stop a station from gathering resorces.  You will get pasenger stations that have coal and iron spliting from a new staion you ran to use the coal and iron, this is the random spawn at era change.  This will split until maxed at the pasenger station, this makes you not want to use that resorce spot when it spawns.  Or you will have to wait if you want a dedicated station line of this resorce out.

Then we could talk about the coins, wood, coal, and steel.  You need them to make to buy the best train engines and train cars, yep NEED that isnt can use that is NEED.  That coinage really looks like some thing from real money ingame cash buy's. Just saying and really worring to look at it like that.  This is where the game breaks down, you will need so many of the wood, coal and steel coins to build trains and add on's that it starts working bacwards, and the coal coins power some expensive trains.  This makes it a needed comodity to run the trains, not only build but keep them RUNNING.  That part isn't bad.   But when you combine the building a train cost, then the run cost, you get one-three and you just don't get the number's of coal needed to build more.  That is a balance issue, and it need to be resolved.

At this point wait for a better ver. to come out of early access, or like I said if you love trains support it.  I will not say it sucks but it needs work and balance to get a recomend.",1507494484,1507494703

But you will even enjoy fixing stuff like that :)

I was actually really surprised how well Mashinky currently runs. The only issue I've experienced in the building mode were disappearing parts of the tracks (occuring on certain levels of zoom), but apart of that, everything works like a charm. Even the ""passenger"" mode, which maybe doesn't offer too much of the detail, but it is still a great experience to enjoy my work of (sort of) art :)

+ Beautiful graphics
+ World generator with many options to choose from
+ Well-arranged building UI 
+ Solid tasks system with tutorial elements in it
+ Unique building (simple) and observing (detailed) modes
+ Only minor bugs
+ Developer support (regular updates, bug fixes, a clear development plan)

- Only simple signalling so far (hard to make more complex stations, crossroads)
- Trains AI (confused trains going the opposite directions than they should can lead to total blockage of your thoroughfares)

If you like the genre and type of game, the only real reason not to play this game at this moment, might be the limited content at the moment. Other than that a worthy descendent in the Railroad-Tycoon-Dynasty with some rough edges here and there but you can already see a little diamond in there.

General features and characteristics
* More like the old railway games, more play, less reality
* Not as realistic as e.g. Transport Fever but faster more responsive gameplay with the payoff of realism
* Innovative new economic system, which often works with goods instead of money as payment and for maintenance
* Dual focus on building and visual experience in two seperate modes which can be switched at any time
* Stations and Industries extendable with buildings
* Multiple areas/topics for decision making and optimization efforts by player
* Already making addictive

Pros and Cons

Game/General
+1 for having real/changeable terrain
+1 for multiple Map Generations Options (density of lakes, hills/mountains, industries, cities etc)
+2 for able to change gameplay rules, e.g. Reversing of Trains, Difficulty, Behaviours, Costs
+1 for the mission- and quest system to spice up the experience and give player even more things and opportunities to do
+3 for the innovative Non-Money (Token) based Ware-System which encourages/forces players to use all industries not just the most profitable
+1 for having a Map Editor -- it's very very simple however with normal game terraforming
+1 for the nice jazz-like soundtrack -- though getting repetitve after some time, so hopefully more in the future
+1 for Mod-Support via Steam Workshop
-2 for the limited content so far
-1 for a rather high price for the current content
[strike]-1 for little gameplay bugs here and there but nothing serious[/strike] -- Fixed most of them

Building/Track Laying
+1 for allowing complex track laying, not just switches also crosses, dual-switches, 3-way switches and so on
+1 for flexibility with tracks on hill-sides to not force the player to level all terrain before track laying
+1 for ingame terraforming
+1 for having Tunnels
+1 for having Bridges, and different kinds of them
+1 for allowing tunneling and bridge building without terraforming allowing over- or underpasses for parallel/close-by tracks
+1 for dual game mode for building and viewing/driving with simplified graphics in building mode
+1 for flexible station system, which allows the player to build the stations
+2 for being able to build extensions for stations, industries, depots
+1 for having a signaling system
-1 for the rigid somewhat inflexible, sometimes non-userfriendly signaling system
-1 for not being able to place signals in tunnels or on bridges

Visual/Environment
+1 for nice graphics of trains, engines, buildings
+1 for having some animations in the world to make it a little more ""alive""
+2 for having different weather-conditions and seasons, gradual change of environment depending on weather and season
+1 for multiple option to view/follow trains and even drive with them
+1 for relative good UI, e.g. Dialogs with snapping, moveable and resizable dialogs, pinning and so on
-1 because 3D-Mode is nice, but not very realistic because of it's simplifications
-1 for some little graphical bugs here and there

Misc
+1 for good variety on engines and cars so far, not too much, not too little
+1 for having waypoints for trains
[strike]-1 for the missing a train length estimation when setup consists in the depot [/strike] -- Now available
-1 for simplified passenger system, which currently ignores distance and destination
+1 for the simplified passenger system based on capacity and time -- still unsure if it's positive or negative
-1 for strange input handling or behaviour now and then
-1 for beeing a 32-Bit applications -- but developer assures it'll cause no memory issues for the time beeing and 64-Bit is on ToDo list
+2 Good communication, although alone dev shows himself on forums and seem to listen to bugreports and suggestions from time to time
+1 Good Update and Fixing times, there were 5 Patches in the first week of release almost daily",1507462810,1507914629

Is Mashinky worth $25? Short answer, not yet. Long answer, it depends.

I bought this game and expected it to be similar to how trains work in Factorio (I havn't played any other Train Tycoons), it's a very similar concept but the logic in Mashinky is poorly implemented. 

CONS:[list]
[*][b]TRAINS[/b] try to drive to a station even if it cant get there.
which leads to
[*][b]TRAINS[/b] try to go through one way signals the wrong way, which they can't.
[*][b]SIGNALS[/b] don't indicate if they start and end in the same block so a train trying to go through deadlocks itself.
[*]chain [b]SIGNALS[/b] are not implemented. They're a must for advanced crossings.
[*][b]BUILD[/b]ING rails by drag and drop is a bit annoying, I would prefer click and click again.
[*][b]GRAPHICS[/b] is not great everywhere. Example, Train wheels spin but coal fuel wagon wheels don't.
[*][b]GAME[/b] is to short to be worth 25$ at time of reviewing.
[*][b]GAME[/b] is not very optimized. I have to run everything at low to get 60fps on a 3570K and R9 Nano.
[*][b]GAME[/b] soft crashes from time to time during loading screens -> Solution: Alt+F4.
[*][b]BUGS:[/b] Sometimes the sound will skip and make a laggy sound.[/list]

PROS:[list]
[*]Great idea overall!
[*]2D and 3D view compliments each other really well.
[*]Nice sounds from both trains and environment.
[*]Hillyness factor adds a great layer of complexity.
[*]Bridges and tunnels work great.
[*]Economy system is great. Fun to manage multi layer cargo processing.
[*]Well written missions that makes you progress.[/list]

TIPS:[list]
[*]Look at Factorio train logic.
[*]Implement a way to tell a train to pause at a station. Example, if there is a lot of iron ore but no coal, the iron ore train can pause.[/list]

CONCLUSION
 
Don't get me wrong, Mashinky is a really fun game and I'm really stoked to see what it will look like in the future, but untill train logic is better, chain signals are implemented and the story is a bit longer I can't say that the game feels complete (no sh*t 2 days after EA release).

So, is Mashinky worth $25? Not if you think you'll get a complete flawless game.

If you realize that it's not finished, you can live with the quirks and you want to support development then it's absolutely worth $25!
 

UPDATE: I've updated the review and now answer if Mashinky is worth the investment for you.",1507461935,1507624973
76561198007252808,598960,False,3,0,0.487566292285919189,399,376,418,37,"nice game but do not buy yet except you want to participate in helping develop this game.

main problem here is that train-pathfinding-ai is literally to dumb to use signals so putting two trains on one track is a difficult task, three or more is a nightmare. gets pretty much frustrating and building effective production lines very cumbersome. 
take the last but on screenshot as a good example. the track system shown there is ok from the logical point of view but ingame the trains would hopelessly get stuck and you'd have to reverse them manually every time resulting in some trains driving right back to the station they departed and screwing up all trains behind them.

track laying needs to be overhauled too. too much of a chore, too much micro management, not enough felxibility. wanting to build a big station with a complex track system for more than two trains? better start leveling the area  because it is not flexible enough. 

terraforming is cheaper than building bridges or tunnels. the latter need reworking too, otherwise they are a mere obstacle than an improvement. or being able to build them diagonally would help, too.

renaming trains would be nice.

when replacing a train it would be nice to being able to replace the engine too without having to create a new train which becomes an unecessary chore eacht time a better locomotive is available even only to place a new ""wait until full"" command.

UI needs improvement. it's not intuitive/flexible enough and still way to confusing/cumbersome. implementing hotkeys would be nice.

oh ... and yes... the graphics are very nice but ""assassins creed"" is the best example that nice graphics is not all that is to a game.

so is it worth it? would i recommend it? right now no, but i'd still give it a 5/10 for the potential. 

probably in a later stage of developement with the aforementioned improvements i would say yes but right now only if you are into these kind of games. there simply have been to many games with wasted potentials.",1507460002,1507460002

This one is rather interesting as the economy has a few nice twists, like constant quest-like tasks that bring rewards and the need for specific resources to build and/or upgrade buildings. Routing is not as free-form as some other games but I've found that with the use of the terrain tool (very straightforward and easy to use) the grid pattern of the terrain is not an obstacle to streamlining your empire. The graphics are very good and the game can be played with NVidia 3D Vision and Tridef VR out of the box (with some tweaks, obviously). I very much look forward to the full release as I've completed the EA portion fairly quickly. Yes, there is a slew of bugs (but, no, signals are not bugged; you just have to figure out the routing rules) but it's still very playable. 

To be fair though, it's not all roses. The economic model is absurdly easy, in fact, almost pointless, and there's no real way to fail. A few examples:

- Maintenance costs for trains are laughably low. So low, in fact, that I didn't even notice they existed until I started exploring all the available menus towards the end of my play time.
- The only reason you need to haul some resources is to get tokens in order to build upgrades or buy some of the better locomotives. There are no actual supply and demand dynamics in the game.
- Distance doesn't seem to matter. You get a dollar per passenger, regardless of how far they travelled (centrally planned economy, anyone ?).
- In terms of interface, it's perfectly fine when you have a few trains to manage but I can see this getting to be quite a chore on bigger maps.

I still recommend the game because many, if not all, of these issues can be tweaked or fixed by final release but, honestly, it's not very challenging as it stands.",1507455456,1507456935

And I mean that with the most respect possible to the developer. They clearly put a lot of time and effort into this game and there are some really fantastic qualities to this game. But its not $25 worthy today.
I'll give some pros first before I get into the problems.
#1: Graphics. There has never been a train simulator with this gameplay quality that has graphics this good. The look of the game is so great it makes it really easy to get immersed without paying attention to any objectives.
#2: Granular control. The way that you buy, set up, and deploy trains is a really cool concept. So is the signaliing. There are some issues with specific things but its early access so let the problems here slide.
#3: Logistical Challenge. Its a lot of fun and interesting challenge to lay track, set up signals, get the right resources to the right stations ,etc. Its less arcadey than Railroad Tycoon games.

That said, I use Railroad Tycoon 3 as my benchmark for the following cons. 
#1: No Markets. This game doesn't have markets that change over geography. That is, a passenger delivered to a city 1 mile away pays the same as a passenger delivered to a city 1000 miles away. Nor is there any demand for commodities. You ship commodities in order to get tokens in order to lay more track in order to get more tokens. Which brings us to the next con.
#2: No Business. The way the company is run in this game more closely resembles the way I imagine a state-run railroad would operate. You don't have shareholders or stock price, no board of directors, no private ownership yourself. The commodities issue is silly because there is no reason to haul commodities unless you want to lay more track. Its impossible to tell your degree of success or failure because there is no meaningful metric. And that brings up point 3.
#3: Too easy. Even if there was competition, the only thing you would be competing for is space to put up stations. The rest of it, the getting money, getting resources, and etc, are almost infinite resources.

These are issues that can and probably will be resolved, but at $25, this game isn't worth buying. Railroad Tycoon 3 still has it beat even though this game has great potential.",1507442755,1507851530

Noticing this, she then drives to the other side of the pump again not taking into account that driving around the pump won't change which side of the car her fuel valve is on.

This is the first thing that comes to mind when I watch the train driver AI in this game.

Time to leave the station, which track will I go down? Hmm one is one way in the direction I want to go, the other has a train waiting to access the station and is one way in the opposite direction. I know, I will try to crash into that other train! 

Slowing the train to a halt in the nick of time, the driver realises that the train is infact going to block its path, so it flips the train and heads back to the station to reevaluate the path it should take.

It then proceeds to do the exact same thing, again, and again, and again, until you decide to force the trains to ignore the signals so that they crash head long into each other to end their pathetic existance. But not before switching to the first person mode so that you can end your own suffering too.

It is a lovingly crafted game that is such a joy to play. The basics of TTD trains are here, but now with more curving tracks and a very satisfying 3D engine.

The industry system has a very interesting overhaul where it's no longer about transporting cargo long distances, you have to consider the inputs and outputs of every part of the supply chain. Industries can also be upgraded to adjust what they accept and what they produce. 

If you're coming from OpenTTD then you'll be frustrated by the signals, but hopefully that's something that is being worked on and will be better in future versions of the game. (It only has 2-way and 1-way signals, not pre or path signals).

Overall this game feels it could be a true successor to TTD and I'm excited by how it'll develop in the future.",1507385700,1507385700

1. Cool rail building system. It's like in OpenTTD, but looks better =)
2. Interesting economy system based on tokens, which you can gain by cargo transportation.
3. Really great to have two modes: realistic and isometric construction mode. In realistic you can see all the beauty of the game graphics and in iso mode you can easily plan and build all needed paths and structures.
4. Graphics in the game is good (but nothing more).

[h1]Cons[/h1]
1. Lack of content. This only applies to the economic part of the game. I know that the game is in the early access now, but it really needs more cargo types and complex production chains to have fun for more than few hours.

I put this game down to supplying villages and towns with goods, making them grow, making huge profits etc etc... the usual train/city sim management. However, what I found was a great transport game that differs in it's execution, let me explain....
You do not 'grow' cities by supplying goods to them. Instead you supply goods to an end manufactorer in return for a currency of sorts. I.e. Supply logs to a sawmill and in turn supply the planks to a tool factory (along with coal) to make tools. With every tool you make you earn a different type of currency.

You have your standard 'money' currency but you also have wood, coal and iron (there may be more I haven't uncovered yet). You can use these currencies to buy trains and wagons etc... some industry and station upgrades can be bought with other currencies. I believe the cities and towns will grow as a result of ferrying around passengers and mail.

The game is also about train management, there is a large emphasise on signal management and ensuring that trains run properly and safely along the lines. Automatically I started thinking about how I could get the most out of my lines using signals which adds additional complexity. You could of course, just add lots and lots of lines and pay the cost for them but I'm not sure that's the point.
I'm really looking forward to seeing where this goes. Below I've listed a couple of pros and cons:

Pros
------
o Good train management simulation
o Complex but not impossible signal management
o The currency system is new and inovative
o Beautiful game
o Relaxing and unobtrusive music
o The amazing 2D building view

Cons
------
o Very new, so limited gameplay at the moment (this will change)
o When trains crash, they just disappear so unless you know where trains 4 and 7 were and what route they were on you have to hunt to see what's missing. (Possible I just missed it)

Overall - Very refreshing innovative change to the train management simulation genre and I forsee good things. It is very new however, so if you're looking for a complete game then maybe don't pick this up just yet. But definitely keep an eye on this one.",1507365842,1507365921

I really like the potencial this game has to be the ""next openttd"". I like the rail grid system and general theme feeling. Also multiple currecies and economy model with station/industry upgrades are interesting.

It's reasonable stable -- I got only one crash in six hours during alt-tab.  But it's still somewhat empty during this stage of development. Also reasonable performance even with moderate number of trains (around 100).

What do I miss the most are any macro management features as duplicate train, any sort of train group management as mass replacing vehicles, mass change of orders and automatic placement of signals with some interval. But I think taht developers will add these in the future. It gets really tedious micromanagement exercise pretty soon.

I would really appreciate better support for separate drop & pickup stations, because atm I did not discover any way of disabling product buildup on drop station. Ability to disable what products are flowing to which station would be great - one way would be through station ui, other is ttd way don't put anything on station till first train with appropriate vagons comes.

Also advanced signaling would be nice -- at least entry&exit (&combo) which should be relatively easy to implement on top of current block signals (compared to implementing PBS).

SOMETHING SEEMS WRONG

The landscape and trains are nice to look at, but the biggest missing piece graphically is that there are no people, no birds, no animals, nothing but deserted houses, streets and stations with ghostly echos of past activites, and zombie trains driving themselves across a green but lifeless world.

THE BIGGEST ISSUES:  

1. There is something wrong with routing - Trains get stuck once the system gets complex (i.e. you add new lines).  It feels like the program is not able to handle additions/changes in real time, and you have to resent everything... trains have no idea what you changed. Something deep seems to be wrong.

2. There is no real ""live"" economy.  The invisible people get onto the empty trains at empty stations with no intent to go anywhere or do anything.  Things get made and shipped into an economy which seems to have no real supply and demands algorithm.

I like it. Building mechanism feels just right and reminds me of the great old isometric games.

Update #1, november 2017:
This game overheated my laptop, 10/10 would overheat again.

Update #2, march 2018:
Bought a new laptop because of this game.
For the first time since SMR, a railroad tycoon game got me hooked. Building a single-train cargo passenger route is easy. Build the stations, connect them, add a depot, buy a train with the right carriages and just click go. So far, getting trains running is very easy.
After that, adding extra trains for additional efficiency becomes a challenge.
To keep things running even smoother, you need more trains, more rails and a lot of signals. Not easy, but a lot of fun. Just when I thought I maxed out the efficiency by reaching the production cap of industries, I discovered extensions, which can triple the output of most industries...

Overall, the core mechanics provide a solid base for one of the best train games in history. The UI however feels a bit clumsy and the available signals sometimes still aren't enough to achieve what you want.",1507306129,1521893713

Speaking of the games, I'm super impressed with the fact that the developer has (so far) left in the ability to out game some of the machines (i.e. figuring out the timing and patterns in order to beat them easier). Another big thing for me has been the accuracy of the games along with the fictional (and creative) branding they have. I'ts impressive the level of detail that has gone into them.

All in all, if you've ever wanted the thrill of beating everything in a Dave & Buster's without the guilt of spending $200, scoop this up for $9.00 (usd).

I am 3452.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 165 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 165 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you",1618240713,1618240713

No joke at all: I am quite enjoying myself and I was not expecting it. The Coin Game takes place in a world that seems to be ran by robots where you are, apparently, the only human around. I actually really love the vibe that the game gives off: you feel like you're alone, but the world is very much alive and you become instantly immersed in it. So far, I have only played the survival mode and have yet to try the birthday mode, but I am still very impressed. It seems that the developer is planning on making more updates and I am very excited for that. The two arcades are fantastic and it makes me so nostalgic going through all of the different games they both have to offer. The models in this game actually look really good, as well, which just adds to the immersion. If I had to recommend a few things to add for future updates, I would definitely like to see more locations added around the map, more jobs for you to do, more vehicles to be able to buy (maybe even add a few car dealerships around the map), the ability to steal the various cars you find in parking lots, and another arcade would also be nice to see. I would also like to be able to interact with the robot NPC's and maybe some of them could give you some side tasks to do. Now that I think about it, a story-mode would be awesome to see one day where you are going through a series of main-line tasks and you can have the option to do side tasks. Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend giving this game a try, especially if you love simulator games like I do.

I never thought I'd get to experience that again ^^.

4 Problems though:

1. There is a small lag that occurs every few seconds or so. This is especially noticeable at the skill coin pushers, where the Player has to stop the rotating light on a specific spot, the lag forces jumps past the targets.

2. Player movement is janky causing the Player to get stuck on machines or near objects necessitating jumping to wiggle free, or reloading a save (big frown face) Game needs an autosave feature that can be toggled on/off.

3. The Audio volume sliders do not work. Only the On/Off of the sound works. I would like to lower the volume without having it disabled entirely, or blaring ridiculously.

4. MOST IMPORTANTLY the Controller inputs. As soon as these get streamlined, and with on screen button prompts for all the commands, this game will be really amazing. I do have fun but, I find myself fighting the controls to move and navigate the menus often.

There are 2 arcade spots, maybe more if I haven't found them but, I would like to see maybe 1 or 2 more locations. I like the UFO pizza/popcorn place, the theme arcades are a great idea, fix the problems, add multiplayer, and this will be a timeless classic ^^.",1617469111,1617469213

this game could have a LOT more to come and needs to expand, if it wants to stay popular and fun, maybe have bi-monthly updates, instead of random ones here and there, even if its just a bug patch or two.
im aware of how hard it can be developing a game and making sure it runs without issues, and im not talking down on it, its just that i feel the last three months we have been left high and dry unintentionally, because the dev is probably fixing or working on something big, or at least i hope.
i love the game and feel it has a lot to come but its just getting to the point where there is nothing pulling me to the game, to want to play it more and more, which is sad because i love the game

Requests to add to the game

Multiplayer
i would personally like to see Multiplayer added sooner rather than later, as the more things you add the buggier it could be, i know this is being worked upon but to be fair, having friends in the game would make it so much more fun.

some more jobs...
maybe a trash picker or a car cleaning process as the three jobs are ok, but they pay too much for a few mins work, and that after four or five times doing it to get money it becomes more of a chore than a actual ""Fun"" thing. 
arcade cleaner.
hotel/motel cleaner/worker
mix it up a little.

weather...
seasons?
rain, storms, hail, snow, maybe even a player too hot or too cold feature where they can lose health, 
and maybe to add with that a clothing range, that gives players curtain effects such as take less cold or heat damage.

child and adult modes: (keeping game PG btw)
some of the things ive listed are fairly complex and will take time to learn, so if you are playing the game, you can toggle ""complex"" mode before you start, where it adds some realism (player stats (cold and heat).)

backpack? 
so you can hold more items, maybe have the capability to re-bag brought food/drink or medical items

random world events:
competitions (win get extra tickets) between ai and real players in real time, highest score on the same machine/game wins

world expansion
have more shops (moving cart shops, ice cream vans.)
move into a motel/hotel instead of staying with your mum in story mode

I haven't played a whole lot, about 2 hours, but I've seen quite a bit of a man named Jerma (I think a pretty big amount of people no who he is, and the odds of that are likely increased due where this is being posted / people might be interested in the game because of him) play it and I originally watched Brutalmoose's video which is what first introduced me to it, and oh man is there a lot more stuff from when I saw that video, I'm talking more arcades, stores, games, this that, so much more than just ""play some games at an arcade"", which really make it feel more authentic, and combine with the fact that it has it's own world with it's own characters, you've got a living and breathing world to battle even the biggest AAA studios have to offer (maybe not quite on that scale, maybe, but I mean hey, you can LITERALLY do anything, I heard the duck that's in the house and went, ""That duck I'm gonna put that b*tch to sleep"", and when I shot him, he went to his bed and went to sleep (although the batch of cookies I was talking about did not). I think that's a big reason why this game has such positive reviews / is so good, because you get what you expect PLUS a bunch of other things. For $8.99 I see this as an absolute steal. Some of the stuff in this game feels so right, and you'll go like ""Oh they even have ___"", an example for ___ could be, ""Laser tag chest plate hanger thingies"". Definitely feels like there was a lot of thought and / or passion put into this epic game. Only thing I can say that's negative really that I'd say is decently annoying is that the claw machines I've used see to be more of trolling you rather than being rigged, as every time I've ever used one in real life they can't grip anything, but in this they grip it, and weaken when it already has a hold of it, but even then that might just be something that many people are used to and I just have happened not to come across claw machines like that. So, I highly recommend this game, and I am excited to see what is to come in the future (of The Coin Game of course, the future of anything else does not matter when I have this piece of art).

Edit: ALTHOUGH the game is no longer $8.99, I still completely think the price is worth it (now $14, $5 more).

Now, my list of stuff that I would love to have in the game in no particular order, although if I had to choose, easily bottom to top (and may already be and I just don't know):

Multiplayer

VR (definitely not the first with this one but hey, 100 peopling telling someone they should do something is more likely to get them to do it than 1)

A way to switch to older version of the game

Purchasable candy at the ticket shops (little piece)

Cards being actually in-game objects you get, same with things like the fidget spinner (this definitely could already be a thing and I just don't know, but if not, I don't think it would be too hard since the models and textures already exist, and maybe with the fidget spinner and things like that you can have an option to sell or keep)

Getting kicked out of the story for getting caught bumping the pinball machine too much (again could already exist)

More customization (like more bikes possibly with more stats, unlockable character customization, trinkets you can hang on the golf cart like little dice, radio for the golf cart, customization for your crane in your house, like different sized claws, different strengths, decals etc., just some ideas)

Cereal that includes a toy (I mean come on, you can't even live without this)

Seasonal events / exclusive items for example, in December for Christmas / other holidays people celebrate, October Halloween / other holidays in the shops as well as / or pop up shops for those holidays

More virtual / video game machines (like those shooting games that blind you every time you fire, fighting games, rhythm games, classic more simple arcades game, etc.) 

Quite ambitious, but a Gamestop like store with consoles (including portables ones than can be played on the bus), games (I mean obviously, although I can't just brush past this because this is arguably the biggest thing in this since you'd have to make several games, but if it just starts off with one console and a few games that would still be awesome, and then more stuff can be added later), gaming merchandise including new characters that have their own games, different types / colors of consoles and controllers as well as seasonal variants



Bonus suggestion (found this Youtube comment of mine that I made tomorrow, two years ago on the Brutalmoose video) although if this were to be added I think this would be more than enough to be a DLC:  This game could be fun if they made a run your own business type thing where you make your own building and buy arcade machines and earn money by having the robot things be your customers.",1616397313,1618610142

PROS:

- The game has a ton of content

- Very well optimized for most computers

- Has a story and doesn't require a constant internet connection (I'm looking at you Anthem)

- Small details make the experience worth playing 

- Devs are listening to the fans

- Has a ton of charm 

- No microtransactions or boosters to ruin the gameplay experience, everything is earned by enjoying the game! 

CONS: 

- Bandaging doesn't stop the bleeding and health runs out if you get ran over no matter what on survival mode (I might be wrong)

- Getting run over by other cars causes you to flop around instead of falling off bike",1615234201,1615243072

I visited the UFO Arcade and was taken to my past. I was able to play Lasertag like I used to do at my local
arcade down the road which has been long gone for years now. While this game is simple in form, it is much
more than a ""Game"" to me. It is a piece of interactive art that takes the player back to the golden age of arcade
suburbia. When you play this game, you will remember things you had no idea existed like some of the prizes available
when you turn in your tickets. I really do miss the arcade days when i used to celebrate a lot of my birthdays
with my friends. I miss sweating from all the running around in the cramped space and asking my parents for more coins.
It really is a blast to the past, to a simpler time before smartphones and mobile apps. This game is a take on a historical past in American culture before the console age and internet took over the industry. I recommend The Coin Game to people who want a relaxing game and a blast to the past. If you're interested, please check out this video I made of the game, it's quite funny some of it.

I was wrong

This game is fantastic! I really have got to give massive credit to the dev(s) responsible. I laughed, yelled, got hooked, infuriated and so much more. All of this is positive, yes even the infuriation.
The arcade games in here really do pull you in. There were even some I remember playing on a regular basis (growing near a sea-side location in the UK). 

There were no major game breaking derps either. 

I still have a lot of the game to explore but I am already so into it and hyped to play it again and again. 

I played this game for the first time on stream and my community received it as positively as me (some even went to buy it before I had finished). 

Maybe I have a new perspective on things thanks to living with Lock-Down but if this game could go multiplayer so I can hang with friends (including my stream community) it would be mind blowing!

Can I just say as well... Laser Tag!!! Heck yes!!! I lived and breathed that back in the day! (Am I sounding old yet?) and to stumble across it in game really sent me crazy with excitement.

Coin pushers, claw machines and the typhoon... yes! A million times yes! 

I really cannot hype this enough. You buy it expecting so little but this game is absolute fire!

Apart from Multiplayer, another suggestion I can think of for the Devs is maybe Gashapon. Those capsule machines would be a great addition.

Oh and I nearly forgot.... I love the nods given to pop culture, certain products, vehicles and oh yes.. a certain movie reference! If you haven't used the Limo service yet please please try it... but make sure you stick around and watch it leave. That little detail right there had me squealing with delight!!

I will finish my review here as I have to go make a start on my choice of cosplay for this year because.... who wouldn't want to be a Rasta Banana right?

The various games aren't particularly complex but they are well implemented and satisfying to play. It's easy to get into the spirit of things, too: there's a simple joy in hopping on your bike in the morning to do your paper round for some money then heading to the arcade or the fairground to blow it all on coin pushers and claw machines.

There are some big ticket prizes to aim for and a golf cart you can save up to buy, plus any prizes you win can be displayed in your house or around town. There are also leaderboards if that's your thing.

The game is still in active development (at the time of writing, a third arcade has just been added with minigolf and 8 new machines), and the dev has a lot more content and features planned, including multiplayer. If you're able to get it at the early access price then it's an absolute bargain, but even once the price goes up it will still be a lot of content for the price.",1612815277,1612815277

When i came across this game i had seen other YouTubers playing it and i was like huh something to easily kill my boredom. Especially through Covid-19 lock down and the closure of local arcades.

The game is Fantastic for how little space it consumes though there are a couple of gripes i had 
Some of the coin pusher games lock up on the bonuses which is likely for good measure. One of the games in the first arcades you visit, Mega drop's real life counter part didn't require you to wait till your first ball was done before dropping another and the only time it stopped was in the bonus mode or mystery points.
The Larry Claw machine also has some physics issues which i can assume would have been the physics issue mentioned in an update post. So I'm hoping it gets fixed with ease! 

I cant wait to play games i haven't played in real life yet and I'm hoping more variations of games already existing in it come around. And for as much work that's getting put in is insane especially for a one manned army! 
I definitely cant wait till we get more games and multiplayer capability! 

Props to the dev for making the game Super realistic in terms of the play environments. And i love the little things like the group of thug robots that hide along side the pawn shop. As well as the Vlogger bots and kids dragging you around in some areas! The curfew system and more. It all seems super realistic for what it would be! 

A message for the dev.
Keep up the good work! i'm loving the game and it brings back memories of the days of when i use to hang out at local arcades with friends. I've already told some of them to pick up the game if they miss it because i know multiplayer is coming soon! As for the amount of work you put in this game really does deserve a lot of praise for everything you've done for it! So keep up the good work!

It's the game I really needed during quarantine. I've had such a mighty need to visit an arcade, and all the fairs got cancelled, so this really helped a lot.

The arcade games are awesome, with the mechanics and physics being super close to the real thing. The sound effects also really make this game feel more immersive. I've always loved coin pushers, but I never wanted to waste all of my tokens on them. Now I can play them to my hearts content and I don't have to worry about wasting my real money on them.

The game world is very charming, and I like that it's not too big but it still takes some time to get from place to place. The option of doing jobs for money is pretty cute too, who knew mowing the lawn could be so satisfying? And Gary...oh Gary, you dramatic little goose. I'm also really enjoying the Survivor mode that was added. It was definitely a welcomed addition.

My critiques of this game are common but small: Obviously there are some bugs since it's Early Access. Sometimes the bike physics get wonkey, and I've had an issue with the babysitter job where I've cleaned up all the toys but it won't let me complete the job. To be fair, those are really the biggest issues I've had.

As for the game play itself, it's honestly all about just adding more options. For example:
-A few more staple carnival rides, like a Merry-Go-Round and a Kiddy Coaster.
-Arcade racing cabinets
-Lightgun games
-DDR where you use the WASD or arrow keys

tl;dr for the money, it's worth picking up. It's a good time, especially during those times when you don't feel like playing anything difficult or intense.",1611783473,1611783473

-The controls. Movement feels like it's on ice, and some of the default keybinds are a little awkward. Getting around the world can feel a little obtuse when your character is taking an extra step.

-Speaking of the world, I wish the interactions with the outside and the little robots rolling around were a little more fleshed out. It's exceptionally cool that there's a whole island to explore, but it seems to me like there's not that much to actually do and find out there. ETA: I don't want to mislead anybody, there IS stuff to do in the world. You'll receive job offers over text to earn more cash, there's a pawn shop as well as other businesses and money making opportunities. In birthday mode, they even give you both a car and a bike to explore the island with. I just wish the NPCs could be talked to, maybe a random NPC could offer you free tickets or some cash or something. The NPCs could tip you off to new jobs, or you could actually get a job at the arcade and get paid for cleaning or moving arcade machines (mechanic for buying new games and customizing the arcade a bit, possibly?).

Poor optimization, the game freezes frames every so often, happens more often when doing the go kart race. Also had save issues and crashes.
Graphics are average and plain.
Can get boring quick, some of the arcade games are pretty boring and only a few are really worth playing in terms of getting tickets or items for cash.
A couple of the achievements are progression based and take way to much time to get, i.e ride 500 carnival rides. 


Pros - 
Decent amount of arcade games to play and carnival rides.
The towns layout is very well done
Good backing by the developer who adds new stuff regularly, the game just got another arcade with even more games added to it.
Voice acting is good even tho its just the developer doing it, the dailogue is funny and witty. 
The nostalgia alone is a huge pro

Conclusion - 
Overall it is a good game and i do recommend it at its current price, but the some times janky controls and poor optimization do take away from it at times , also the graphics don't bother me to much but it would be nice to see them improved. 

What i would like see added - 
Being able to customize the golf cart, i.e upgrade its storage, gas tank size, engine speed, color etc. 
Ability to buy your own arcade with money you earn in game, being able to buy different arcade machines of your choosing to put in your arcade as well as the prizes.  In general more things to do with the money you earn.
Bigger variety of chores to do 
More vehicles to purchase and drive
Possibility to buy a bigger house and items to furnish it with
Different buildings like restaurants or something along those lines to make the town feel more immersive.",1611531555,1611531609

I just looked at some photos, got a general impression from comments, and went for it. You cannot have this amount of fun at any real arcade for $10, so the value in this game for playing arcade games is multiplied through this digital landscape. I look forward to future updates, as I see some areas in the game's environment are still under construction in the world (crates, constructions walls, signs, construction equipment), so I know there is a lot more fun to be had in the future.

You simply gamble, buy food, gamble, buy food and eventually buy the golf cart and that's mostly it of what I have catched my eye on. The gameplay heavy relies on gambling and early game at managing your money and travelling around the map. The game can be fun as it covers a good amount of different minigames that you can play. In my hour of playing and another hour of watching a VOD of xQc playing this game, I met a few bugs. It being physic bugs, clip bugs, your bike for some reason being put inside of a building upon exiting it, loopholes in the economy and probably more. They are not a big deal and are absolutely fine for a early access. There is also performance issues. As example: If I get on my bike, the game for some reason lags for the time my character gets on it. I have a proper enough graphics card that should be able to run this smooth enough. I just personally need something that I can do, that is fun, by winning stuff. Not JUST gambling. But that's just what I imagine.

In my book though, I'll refund as I personally just can't find my fun with it even though it looked different at first. Give it a try, maybe you'll like it!

Also, what is the point of you being the only human in the game and the rest of the NPCs are robots? Not a big fan of that, but oh well.

This one-man project is constantly being updated with new locations and games! For a fun, relaxing arcade simulation, its a superb choice and for the price, definitely a must-try for some family-friendly fun! Especially for those unable to get to a real arcade, this is the next best thing! 

The Coin Game currently offers 3 unique arcades: 
Larry's: A more classical Chuck E Cheese style arcade. 
UFO Arcade: A modern arcade featuring a go-kart track and laser tag.
One-Eyed Billies: A pirate-themed arcade resembling a roadside attraction. Lovely and tacky, with it's own unique charm. Features mini-golf and soon a shooting gallery in a later expansion. 

There is also an Amusement park, featuring rideable rides as well as some classic midway games. 

There are 2 main game modes, Birthday and Survival. Birthday is the ""freeplay"" mode and is very casual. The player has access to these money blower machines (similar to the ticket blaster at Chuck E Cheeses) where you can enter at any time and grab money, hence you never run out of money and can play infinitely. Survival mode adds a health and energy system, with the player needing to make money to buy food and get home before curfew. 

There really isn't a progression system, though each game has it's own leaderboard, which is pretty fun to climb up with each win. Total ticket counts also have their own leaderboard. 

As for controls, they are mostly what you expect. You play in a first person perspective and WASD is walk, you look around with mouse... Exc. The only important thing is that TAB opens your smartwatch menu which is used for a variety of things, like fast travel as well as inventory. Additionally be sure to save your game in the ESC menu outside a building before quitting to save progress. 

Music is pretty good as well, with each arcade game generally having it's own music track and/or sounds as you expect. (They are based off of the real-world versions with great focus on detail.)

Overall, I highly recommend the game! For the price of 8 bucks, I would have been content with just one arcade, however, given all that Devotid has put into the game, you definitely get your money's worth! It is also very kid and streamer friendly! 

The only negative I have to note is that this game might not run well on older computers/toasters. This game has a free demo feature, including 2 of the games at Larry's and is a great stress test if you are unsure if you are able to run it. Other than that, if you enjoy arcades or just fun, casual and laid-back experiences then you will feel right at home here. 

Bottom line: (TL:DR) This is a very well done arcade and recreation simulation game with plenty of things to do and discover!",1610076306,1610076306

but recently i was watching tomato gaming play it and saw that the devs had recently added a ""survival mode."" which instantly caught my attention.

in survival mode you play as a 19 something (i assume hes over 18 because you can buy lotto scratchers.) manchild who seeks to live off his winnings at the local arcade as apposed to getting a real job

you will manage your health and energy by consuming high amounts of corn syrup and sugar through cheesy poofs and soda that you have purchased with money you won from lotto scratchers and playing the plushy market.

yes the plushy market, the local pawn shop will give you at most $2 to $3 dollars for your pizza and child saliva soaked pink elephant but on random days in the crack induced stupor the pawn broker will add the 20x or 30x markup for the purchase price of random carnival and arcade prizes, want my advice for making fat stacks? go around the map and memorize the source for all plushies and prizes and save/load until the pipe hitting pawn broker annouces that he will pay $500 for a roger rabbit plush

then go to the local carnival and grind that shit out, soon your weak greasy manchild avatar will transform into a wealthy greasy manchild that hogs the go kart track until 3am, why? because he fucking paid for 50 laps and hes gonna get them.

anyway the coin game is a very charming and unique game for those who love in depth unity games, just as a warning there are bugs, lots of them, once i grabbed a number 7 plusie from a claw machine to sell for a hefty sum of jerry's arcade tickets when all the numbers at once dissapeared, then in the next second all of matter decayed in a instant and i ceased to exist 

so be sure to save often.",1610044692,1610044858

I wish there was a feature to load up x amount of credits instead of it defaulting to 1. Its a little annoying to have to press 'play again?' every single time. Something similar to the coin pusher games would be perfect, just expand that to every game.

Also we need a casino in the game! Modern casinos are essentially arcades and Im trying to spend some big money here. How else am I going to spend 10,000 credits at once.

A few disclaimers and what I have to say about everyone who disliked this game.
- If you’re complaining about lag or taking forever for it to load, your computer is trash. THIS GAME IS VERY DEMANDING!
- This game IS STILL IN BETA so stop complaining about bugs, most of them aren’t even a big deal anyway.
- This game IS MADE BY ONE PERSON, so y’all need to be patient with the guy he probably has a lot to keep up with

Anyway thanks for reading, the game is amazing and you should buy it.

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
[i]This review is an early access review! This review only reflects the state of the game when I reviewed it! 
The setup of the game was quite clunky and unhelpful at best, the comical unspecific 'tiers' of graphics don't help and far from the 'highest' setting the game fully used my RTX 2060 and [b]FIVE GIGS OF RAM[/b]. That aside a part of the screen is cut off as if the game is too zoomed in which can't be fixed in the settings[/i]
The Coin Game is a simulation game of anything Arcade and Carnival games filled with funny off-brand references and names.

[h1]Visuals and Mechanics[/h1]
The visuals of The Coin Game really aren't impressive at all, everything looks flat and devoid of vibrancy which you'd expect from a farming sim game 5 years ago and not from an Arcade or Carnival setting, the whole game looks flat and 'dull'. As for the mechanics most of the arcade games play very accurately like the original machines they were based on which is an impressive feat.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The first thing I noticed when playing the game is that interacting with the environment is split between LMB and RMB which is really strange and despite you having the option to change it the entire time playing felt like trying to read the onscreen prompts which one needs to be used this time. The machines and carnival games are very accurate representations of the actual machines and it's really fun to play them with superhuman coin spamming skills however some of the mechanics aren't quite there yet though like the Mega Drop making you wait for the ball to enter a cup which might take [b]literal[/b] minutes. You also tend to get stuck on things [b]very[/b] easily and the carnival rides I entered for fun to have a look made me more motionsick than a real ride! And as a last note, which is hard to describe in text, the game lacks that visual feedback of getting a big win or doing something cool. It just feels completely emotionless and devoid of vibrancy like a sarcastic hurray and a golf clap which doesn't hook you in to keep you playing which I hoped I would as I love mindless coin pushers and skeeballing.

[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]
The soundtrack of The Coin Game while accurate, is a loop of blown out distorted 'in the distance' generic 'hype-tracks' that will quickly get on your nerves. As for the sound design, it's an equally annoying wall of repetitive children, off-putting robot voices and background noises. I have to admit A+ for accuracy! but it would help to have more sound clips so that it's a bit less obviously the same noises all the time.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
While a very good representation of the arcade and carnival 'mechanics' I personally feel like the graphics let it down quite a bit and I can't stand how often the game automatically drags your mouse away from what you're trying to do like interacting or aiming. That paired with the clunkiness of playing and instability like the game freezing when trying to quit made me sadly refund this game at the current time. Don't get me wrong however! Give the developers another year to further polish this game and The Coin Game will be a fantastic game to play. Sadly for the state it's in now and there being no discount (even during a sale!) for your 'privilege' to play an unfinished game I have to say that I don't recommend The Coin Game.",1608726367,1608732407

The main gameplay element is playing arcade games like you'd find at a Dave and Busters but there's a lot more to it than that. The game world, Islandville, has its robot denizens, a few shops, a bus route, jobs, and places to explore. You may think this is a game you put a few hours into for the novelty and not go back, but I myself am drawn to keep playing it. The Coin Game accomplishes atmosphere very well; the game reminds me of nights out as a teen with friends going go-karting, laser tagging, and playing arcade games on a birthday party night. For $9 and an invested developer it's a worthwhile experience.

Game Areas:
Larry's Arcade - Where the game got its start, Larry's Arcade is reminiscent of your locally-owned arcade shop. There's at least a dozen fun games that you can capitalize on quite easily with the prized Rasta Bannana running you a pretty 65,000 tickets. There's also a periodic animatronic show featuring life-sized performers of their prize selves like the Rasta Bannana.
UFO Point - To the south end of the island, UFO Point is more akin to your local go-kart/laser tag venue with at least a dozen arcade games as well. The laser tagging isn't developed like a FPS and it's good that way; it gives you the feeling you have when playing laser tag with imprecise aim and clustered people all shooting each other. The go karts are pretty well-programmed for what they are; most won't like the steering but it's realistic.
Carnival - The carnival has rideable rides and carnival games, with the same gimmicks within them as real life. I haven't ridden any rides yet but have played the carnival games and have Shoot the Star down now after $80 in-game dollars spent.

Speaking of dollars, there's ways to earn money on the island. You can deliver newspapers for $2/per, babysit $20/day, and mow someone's lawn for $50/day. You can also go around and scavenge trash and recyclables to take to the pawn shop to earn money. Heck, even the pawn shop as a pseudo stock market system where different items will earn you more money on particular days and often-times they're prizes from arcades. With your money, you'll need to buy gas for your golf cart, food/drinks to keep you energized, and for miscellaneous items like fish food for your house.

All in all, the game thus far implemented a scaleable world that makes me look forward to future development. I don't have any negative feedback for the game, but some things I would like to see include:
*Conversations with robots
*More job types
*Multiplayer and competitive games
*Collectibles to find in the places to explore like the mountains, nature trail, and etc.

You come to this game expecting something very specific and end up finding out there is a lot more to it than you thought.  I would have been happy with just a video game version of a cheesy arcade, but this game is a whole world set in a fictional village called Islandville.  The arcades and the machines are awesome enough, but a big part of this game involves travelling from arcade to arcade, to the carnival, pawn shop, grocery store, gas station or home.  You can travel by limo, bus, golf cart, hoverboard or bicycle.  It has a Grand Theft Auto exploration vibe, set in a world full of ticket redemption arcades. Your only weapon is a rubber band gun and you don't steal cars.  It is full of all kinds of wacky characters (who all happen to be robots).  You also have a home to go back to where grandma robot lives and your pet goose keeps you company.  The game has bugs to be sure, but they can be entertaining and the game is still in early access so it is understandable.   The machine physics are really amazing and do an incredible job of recreating the experience of playing these games. The most incredible thing is that this is being developed by one guy!!!!  This is a real labour of love for this guy, and it shows in how much fun this is to play.  He is probably losing a lot of sleep bringing us more locations and features, so we really need to support him.  For this effort alone I hope he makes $10,000,000.  In case there was any doubt, I recommend EVERYONE buy this game.  It cost less than the price of playing at a real arcade for 10 minutes, and you can play it as long as you want without emptying out your bank account.  You will not be disappointed even if you are not into arcade games.  Just exploring the world is fun.",1607998558,1607998558

If you're a fan of physical arcade games, y'know, the type that you win prizes and tickets from, but don't want to worry about losing actual money, then get this. The arcade machines are actually pretty fun to use and give you that ""bright lights in your face"" and ""shiny sounds"" feeling you get from playing lotto machines and, trust me, it becomes about as addictive as crack cocaine. And trust me, I'd know.
It takes me back to playing in the casino in Tower Unite. All the bright flashing lights and sounds playing just suck you in for hours and, soon enough, you'd either be down or up tens of thousands of credits and it just makes you feel good.
It is a bit unrealistic because I actually seem to win more than I lose, but maybe I'm just good at physical arcade games, who knows?

Pros-
-The sheer accuracy to a real arcade experience is astounding. It feels like you're actually at an arcade, minus the crying children, simultaneously greasy and sticky buttons, and that gross stale-pizza-and-cigarettes smell. If you've never been to an arcade in your life, this is the perfect game to see what it's like. The physics on the different games is remarkably realistic, especially on the coin pushers. Most of my playtime has been spent playing Dunko and Popcorn Pete to the point I think I blacked out one time and when I came to I had like three Popcorn Pete plushies from accumulating so many cards.
-There's a survival mode where you have to earn all of your money, maintain your health, and be responsible with your arcade addiction. There's also a freeplay ""birthday party"" mode where you have unlimited money (thank you Uncle Phil!) and can play all you want without worrying about anything. The latter released first, and it's perfect for when you just want to sit back after a long day and unwind.
-If you get bored of the arcade games, there are so many more things to do! You can play laser tag, ride on a go-kart track, drive around town in a golf cart, buy illegal fireworks at the carnival... Did I mention there's a carnival? It's just as fun as the arcades, but as you'd expect, the games are a little rigged and the prizes aren't as cool, but hey, it's accurate to a real one! You can also just walk around and enjoy the town; it's very peaceful and sometimes you'll discover something new. At the time of writing, the next arcade will add mini golf, a shooting gallery, and an RC ship game, so there's even more stuff to look forward to.
-When you go home, you are greeted with the best pet in the world. I won't spoil the surprise, but when you get done playing at the arcade you should really take a gander at him.

Cons-
-The player characters look very dorky (especially the female player), but you barely see them since the game is played in 1st-person mode. The real focus of the game is on the games, so this isn't that big of a deal.
-There aren't too many crane games for those of you who love playing those (I can think of the cow one, number ball one, and the one you have at home). I would love it if a future update had a new arcade similar to Round One and its Japanese-style cranes, since those are one of the machines I've been missing the most since 2020 happened. Again, not that big of a deal, just some wishful thinking.

I cannot give this game a bigger recommendation. Please try it out if you're in the mood to play something more relaxing (or stressful if you want to play in survival mode, haha)!",1607122284,1607122284

I love this game to pieces, and have only played for 3 hours. If you are reluctant, don't be! It's worth 3x the price. The only true negative is some performance issues, not huge, but minor. I have a RX 5600XT card, which is pretty good for 1080p and 1440p, however, it can be buggy some times. Thank you very much Devioted! I love this game. Recommended to anyone!",1606700131,1606700131

Only issue i have had with the game is lag, but i try to optimize it the best i can, and i believe its because im using Parallels too, since i have a Mac, that the lag just gets a bit worse, but it does not take away from the games at all! I do wish they add a version for Mac too <3

The mini-golf course entertaining a couple groups of people while they made idle chat. Off in the most spacious corner, the speed demons among us were practicing their mad max road warrior skills. Then over in a separate black-lit room, kids like me were laser tagging like we were fighting in Fallujah or Hue City, the heavy smell of the vests and machine made fog.

This game touched on almost all of these memories, that alone makes it worth the money for me.

As for the presentation of this game, well it's early access and it shows. It don't look great, it handles like a bare rimmed Segway on ice, and the areas between the arcades are a little empty. But gosh darnit I like it. I'm willing to accept the early access look and feel in return for remembering these experiences. 

While the open world is a bit lack luster, The arcades are spot on. While the handling is slippery, it makes some of the games even more fun. While the graphics are a little simple and cheesy, they seem unique and interesting.

My two gripes are that there isn't any online multiplayer, so you cant laser tag and go kart with the boys. And you cant get into the beer garden at the county fair.",1605737690,1605737690

Your entertainment consists of seedy arcades, a travelling carnival, and illegal fireworks. You earn money by using your tickets for prizes, and selling them at a ramshackle pawn shop owned by a cigarette smoking swindler. You leave the pawn shop and a gang tries to mug you, as you fight them off with a rubber-band gun. Drivers have no regard for human life, and won't hesitate to run you over on your bike if you're going too slowly. Factories laden with graffiti dot the landscape, with workers who are hyper focused on their task. You barely have enough money to feed yourself, and are stuck in a cycle of slaving at the arcades, selling prizes at the pawn shop, and buying gummy bears, jawbreakers, cheese puffs, and energy drinks to keep yourself alive. You use your last bit of money on a scratch lotto, trying to hit the jackpot and break out of this cycle. You lose, and are now penniless and starving. You die from hunger and sleep deprivation in the convenience store, as the clerk patiently watches and does nothing.

So do I, and this game brings me back to the days of being absolutely spoiled rotten on my b-day. Notably the entire vibe of the game just gives off a sense of child-like wonder and excitement, and letting you run free with your uncle's credit card in an arcade. The point being, this game is what every kid wanted in the early 2000's and to see a game replicate it so perfectly is amazing (not to mention by one dude.) So for everything this game does, and does right I personally give it 5 stars.





Ok, with the review out of the way I have a question for Mr. Developer Man (I don't know his name so I'll call him that for the time being.) How and why is the player the only human on this island? Like I know it's a game but sometimes it just creeps me out (in a existential sense.) The reason i ask this is because i feel sorta attached the player character itself and wonder why they are just like, ""this is fine."" My point being, are we gonna get to learn more about this maybe via lore during the survival mode? Because that would be really cool.

The way the game looks is simplistic to where its aesthetic as fuck. Even if you have never played arcade games you will 100% feel nostalgic playing this game. The graphics remind me of older windows games and I love it. There is a wonderful variety of gameplay not only just arcades but with just exploring and seeing the sights and other features this game has to offer. The game isn't all just about arcades there is so much more to it. If you are looking for a game to play to kill time or just have fun and just sit back and relax this is the game.

Not only that, but you can tell what they're actually supposed to be. Some examples include Popcorn Pete beinga SpongeBob Squarepants Pineapple Arcader, Dizzy Bird being Dizzy Chicken, Big Bass Wheel'in being Big Bass Wheel, Dunko being The Price is Right: Plinko, Stackem being the infamous Stacker, and Prize Master being Key Master. I've been to enough arcades to know what those games are supposed to be. It would be nice to see games like Flamin' Finger, Fast as Light, Tower of Power, Dunk N' Alien, an arcade basketball, and air hockey (maybe that Pac-Man one). A bowling alley would be a smart addition.

Now let's get to the pros and cons (for two of these cons, I'm willing to help you. I could possibly be a part of your team.)

Pros: 
Multiple fun zones to go to, not just one, but currently three, and soon to be FOUR! There's a good amount of things to do, and I believe that justifies the 8 dollar price tag. Get it before the price increases ladies, gentlemen and enbies!
Accurate representations of arcade games despite being changed in design for reasons related to copyright.
Attention to detail allows you to ride the carnival rides. Still loads of games which overlook such meaningless things because they serve no purpose to gameplay, so it is always nice when there's attention to details that others would deem useless despite there being no limitations, it's charming.
A Back to the Future reference! +69.420 points.
Loads of content updates, even early access games can end up receiving very little content updates, so thank you for your constant developing. I understand exactly why too. This is the first game you made where you struck it big, so you wanna keep it afloat for as long as you can.
Asphalt isn't glossy like it was rained on, but is still specular just like real asphalt.

Cons: I shall start with the two I can help you with.
The textures are ugly. They are so low resolution that you can see the pixels even with the texture filter. This game was from 2019, they shouldn't be this low in resolution. I can help upscale them, you just gotta give them to me, or allow me to access a devmode or something that can show me the files.
The sound design is too stock. I can help overhaul the sound design to feel more unique. I can even do voices for the games if you'd like, I feel the Big Bass Wheel'in game needs it. I already contracted with another small developer for sound design earlier this year. Please reply or message me if you're interested and we'll talk business. I can be the first new member of your team.
THIS ONE'S IMPORTANT: The movement is so janky that it's a chore to get up a set of stairs. A total rework in the movement script would be viable before leaving early access.
There's no bloom or anti-aliasing, but luckily this problem is solved with Reshade. Thankfully this game is compatible with Reshade.
The environments feel desolate and uninhabited. I swear, the game at night looks like a horror game.
Game is still glitchy and buggy, but that's to be expected, my expectations aren't the highest for a redemption game simulator made by one guy in Unity, so it's fine as long as you try to fix them, then you're good.

Remember, message me if you are up for me joining your team.",1604631918,1604631918

Have I had issues? occasionally, but I can't honestly say it wasn't my computer at fault since for the most part I haven't really had a problem with this game, and certainly nothing that would put me off recommending this game. There's plenty here, the island is big, and accessible in an 'open-world' kind of way; I took the liberty of walking around instead of using transport to see if there were any 'dead' spots that hadn't been properly programmed, I haven't found any yet and still haven't been all round the island, even under water the ground has gradients just like a lake would; also random puddles here and there, and different fence/barrier types to protect the pedestrians when other devs might just use one style of fence throughout; all sorts of subtle detail and thought has gone into this game; you can even climb rocks, and have you spotted the serious rode accident yet? Though why a military tank is there makes me wonder just what's really going on.  Although I doubt there's any easter-eggs to find by exploring it's still worth the effort to go off track just to appreciate the work that's gone into this game and the island itself.

I'm still trying to comprehend that this is all done by a single dev; he has truly crafted a superb game, the arcade games themselves, many of which I still haven't played since I've been hooked on the ones I have played, are truly exceptional and realistic in their game-play; and the rides... wow! They may be short in duration, just like they are in real-life, but if your computer can handle the speed of some of them they are well worth going on, I love the Pirate Ship and the Whirly-gig thingy; I'd never do it in real-life as I suffer motion-sickness but you definitely get the right feels here.

Honestly even if the unexpected happens and there are no further updates to this game there is enough here to more than justify the purchase price, I've spent more and got less on other games than what I have here and from the store description there is still plenty more to come to get excited about!

If there is anything that I might like to see (which may be in the help but I didn't notice it), some of the games aren't self-explanatory and take a while to figure out, so a little guide on the side of the machine or an 'interact with' info sheet would help me from wasting Uncle Phil's money as I try to work out how to win; but on the whole most of the games are 'point and click' easy, so I'm really nit-picking here.

I look forward to seeing what the dev does with this game in the future, and I'm truly grateful for discovering this game and what he's done with it so far. Thank you kind sir!",1603914426,1603914426

The only real gripe I have is that during survival mode (I know it still needs work, but it's my favorite mode to play in the game, the challenge is very rewarding. ^^) sometimes the mowing job and the babysitting job sort of ""break"" or won't be present for me to do again. The mowing job grass won't grow back, or the babysitting job objectives won't get completed, but I can remedy that by quitting and coming back into the game, so it's not a major set back. All in all, this is a very fun game. Arcades where I can win prizes, especially plushies, have always been a weakness for me but I never really get to go anywhere due to my problems with depression and the fact that I don't have the money. I'm a big fan of collecting things so the prize aspect, along with the fact that I can keep the prizes in my room, is my favorite part of the game.

Survival mode....Is it really game over when you die? No reloading where you left of?

Ideas....would be cool if you could buy any machine in the game to play at your home for free. Like just copy paste it into your garage or bedroom. Also decorate your room with posters and prizes like trophies. 

Getting home by curfew is hard enough but waking up with half energy just takes more time out of the day when you want to leave because most of the time you get home before curfew and have to wait around a bit. A full nights sleep should give you 100hp and energy.

76561198040904558,598980,True,1,0,0,1643,1316,40,16,"The Coin Game is one of the most bizarre dreamlike games I have ever played.

The main focus of the game revolves around arcade games that feel authentic. They are authentic in that they not only recreate the look and feel of the game, but it also recreates the atmosphere around the game. Hitting a big jackpot can result in people crowding around you cheering for you. The arcade buildings have thoughtful names and designs that create an overall theme. The ambiance of other games being played fill the air.

Are the games fun to play? The answer is yes. Most of the games are fun and some are even a little addicting. For example, the coin pushers have polished physics and different variants. Some will have you collect cards while others will have you timing the coin to land on a moving light. There are however some games that need improvements and aren't as fun because of this. Claw machines need the most work. Computer physics don't really work well to simulate soft objects, squishy objects, or different material types. The one claw machine that does feel ok is the one that has plastic balls with different ticket values on them. This is due to the ball shape resulting in more accurate feeling physics when it comes in contact with the claw. I'm hoping that these can be improved at some point to allow for more organic objects. Aesthetically, all the games look stunning. My personal favorite to play is the Mega Drop. The goal is to drop bouncy balls into a spinning circle with holes. The physics feel similar to the real life arcade version.

This then leads to the second half of the game. Without spoiling too much, this game allows the player a lot of freedom to discover new things. The developer is not afraid to add in weird game mechanics that would normally never be included in an arcade simulator. This leads to an almost surreal experience. But because the game does such a good job at the core gameplay of arcade games, these extra details do not take away from that if a player is not interested in them. The developer is aware of this and has mentioned that they see the game more as a childhood simulator instead of just an arcade simulator.

With the high level of authenticity comes a downfall. The game requires higher end computers to play it. Due to the simulated physics and the detailed 3D models, you will need a mid-tier to high-tier CPU and GPU to have a chance at playing. The system requirements listed for the game are accurate. Integrated Intel GPUs will not be good enough to play the game. Additionally because this game is being developed, there are parts of the game that are not optimized yet. So performance may improve in the future.

Game bugs are also everywhere. The game is in development, so bugs are to be expected, but it does feel like more bugs are being introduced in each update than they are being fixed. The bugs can range from things you might not ever run into, to bugs that affect the arcade games, to issues with running The Coin Game on your computer. I haven't run into any major issues myself, but bugs have impacted the gameplay experience from time to time.

This unoptimized in-development game is reflected in the cost. $9 USD is a bargain considering that going to a real arcade costs more. You only need to play The Coin Game for a few hours to justify the price. However, the price will go up as the game becomes finished and no longer considered in-development. The developer has mentioned that they will not put the game on sale, so the current price is the lowest it will be.

Due to the large scope of the game, and the game only having one developer, there is a very real chance that development on the game could stop at any time. I would only purchase the game if you feel the content and game performance in its current state is acceptable.

The sandbox mode to just do whatever you want as much as you want is great. Arcade games, Fair/Carnival games, Fair/Carnival rides and more!
The survival mode was a nice surprise, that's pretty fun as well with the odd jobs and trying to not pass out, while also trying to earn enough money to play games and such, it's great.

Seriously the game sells itself short for its price tag. there so much in it now that the dev deserves more money for the hard work. 

theres currently two game modes, birthday and survival

Birthday is basically freeplay, no worries of money of managing stats and is a good mode to try out the games, find ones you like and practice at them to get good at them for survival

Survival is where you have to manage things like money, energy, health and time. its not too terribly hard to stay alive  but if anything will kill you in this mode it will either be losing track of time at an arcade or getting hit by the reckless drivers. still its a fun game mode that can surprise you with how much fun you can have to earn that play time at the arcades.

The Coin Game is an open world sandbox life simulator where you explore an island inhabited by robots and animals that holds a multitude of arcades and a carnival to earn tickets, win prizes, and then sell the prizes for money to play more games and amusements. There is a Birthday Mode which is a sandbox and you're free to explore and earn money fast, and then there's Survival Mode where you have to manage health, energy, battery power, as well as making sure your pets at home are fed. This game is in early access but it already has a bunch of real life arcade machines and rides for you to mess around with.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
- Good Graphics
- Quirky Humour
- Multiple Arcades to explore
- Carnival with rides and games
- Lots of fun prizes to win

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- A couple of bugs, sometimes you'll glitch through stuff, sometimes you'll need to reapply your coin card to play machines.

Sure there's the sandbox mode which in its own right is fun, but in my opinion the survival mode MAKES THIS GAME. You do errands to get money, to play the arcade, to get prizes that you sell off or horde for your own personal collection.

This is a game I never knew I wanted. I've been into arcades for a long time but it has always been hard for me to even play arcade games where I live. I've always had a small itch for arcades and have been watching youtube channels covering the topic for a good bunch of year. The moment I had heard about this game, I had fallen in love with it instantly and just couldn't wait to play it while it downloaded.

You play in the shoes of a birthday boy. Your uncle being the amazing uncle he is, gives you unlimited credits to play at any arcade in the city. If leeching isn't your style, you can also do jobs such as delivering newspapers and babysitting to earn money. The game has any arcade your heart could desire, from simple claw machines all the way to lazer tag. There is not much to say about the game. It's an amazing arcade game, and I can't fight the urge of coming back to it on the regular. Another reason I keep coming back is that the game is receiving updates regularly.

In of itself, the concept is really simple, but I don't know why no one has done it before devotid.

All in all The Coin Game offers you:
[list]
    [*]Many different arcades for you to try out

Couldn't figure out why I loved it so much till I saw someone asking if it was inspired by Thrillville when I was younger. Remembered how much I loved that game and this probably hit that some note.

Some features I would really love and also think would make the game better:

- More goals to aim for;

The golf kart is a pretty good example of a goal to aim for. However, saving up to buy the golf kart is just a matter of finding the easiest game to play over and over to make money, which is [spoiler] playing the balloon popping game and selling the pink ice cream cone prize. [/spoiler] This is problematic because there's a lot of games which are much more detailed, fun and interesting, but there isn't a ton of reason to play them besides having fun, which is tough in survival mode because you're spending currency to have fun, when you could buy bulk gas and supplies instead. So I think there should be a stronger implementation of goals related to specific machines and types of machines perhaps, and particularly weird and helpful prizes for playing them. (Rubber band ball bazooka?)  

That's the main thing I think would be important for this game's future. Some other quick things would be:

- Some world customisation/character customisation beyond placing items like upgrading your garage, golf kart, etc. 
- Unlockable arcade areas in survival, rather than being able to play everything as soon as you start. This would create a basic progression system, you have to play in let's say Larry's arcade exclusively until you make a certain amount of tickets, then you are allowed access to UFO point, would could be altered to reward more tickets and higher selling prizes, to give the player something to aim for and a reason to play all the arcades more thoroughly. 


Anyways, love the game. Keep at it!",1599646281,1599646281

Going through it, I got flashbacks to going to chuck e cheese as a kid and going to the local small town arcade with my aunt. The atmosphere in this game is excellent. As for the games themselves, those are excellent too! Almost all the classic arcade games are here, like skee ball, and mega drop. My favorites are the Mega Drop and the Dunko coin pusher. Not only is the quality of games good, but so is the quantity. With two whole arcades as well as a fair filled with classic fair games, there are an abundance of things to do. And that's only at the time of this review! The developer is adding stuff to the game reasonably regularly. At the time of this review they're working on a whole new arcade! The game also features a survival mode which admittedly i haven't dived into yet but it seems like it'd be real fun.

Of course nothing is without its blemishes, and though i do heavily recommend this game, boy does it have it's blemishes. For one thing, the claw machines are super glitchy.  The ones where you pick up the balls and the cows aren't too bad, but the one where you pick up the letters is nearly impossible to win. As soon as the claw reaches the top, any letters it might have in its grasp glitch out and teleport to the outside of the claw, falling back into the machine. In my current 6.3 hours of play, i have literally not one a single ticket from that machine.

Then there's the optimization. Its not good. How optimization is done is through a menu that you select your computers power through and it adjusts the video settings accordingly. While this sounds great on paper, condensing all the complicated video settings mumbo jumbo into just one option, it horrendously fails in execution. My computer is reasonably powerful, its no gaming computer mind you, but its still reasonably powerful. And yet even at potato settings, the game never went higher than 15 frames a second. I had to change the resolution on the computer itself to nearly its minimum for the game to become playable. And even then all my key strokes are delayed by about half a second. Have you ever tried to play pinball with a half second delay on your flippers? Let me give you a hint. It doesn't work. Thankfully, that's my biggest gripe. 

In conclusion, this game rocks. If you at all enjoy the feeling of going to the arcade, you need to play this game. Just make sure you turn your computer's resolution down if need be.",1599510469,1599510469

This game is a FANTASTIC collection of your standard ticket arcade games, each more fun than the last. The mechanics of each are perfectly executed and act exactly as you would expect them to. Earning tickets is a treat and you can spend them on items that are as useful as they tend to be in real life (i.e. not at all).
There are leaderboards to see where you stand globally or within your friends list.

Arcades have totally disappeared in the last 10 years and with covid the ones that are left (mostly barcades for me) are essentially defunct. If you miss this kind of thing, or have ever been to a ticket arcade and had fun, this game is definitely for you.

Outside of the games themselves there are other minigames like lazer tag, kart racing, and scratch offs that are somewhat fun and a survival mode that makes gambling or winning those tickets mean life or death. There are some great and interesting systems such as buying food by placing it on a counter and riding a bus (which is about as realistically fun as you can imagine).

The graphics are... not great. Within the games themselves you can expect great quality but look anywhere else and you will be disappointed if you're expecting AAA quality. It's average or lesser at best on your character models (there are two with 6 total clothing options. Becky and Mega-chad).

Audio can be passable but hit the jackpot more than once in a row (some timing games) and you'll hear overlapping audio. Each machine has the same jackpot noise.

It's like a gutpunch in the nostalgia department and takes me back 90s, to the good old days of me being a grade school kid saving his money for a week then going to the arcades or amusement park on a saturday to enjoy the whole day with my friends or family. The arcades and amusement park has varieties and a lot of games to choose from, so you have a lot of stuffs to do and wouldn't get bored easily. It's also fun and easy to get tickets because it's fair, unlike in real life where the arcades are meant to be unfair so that they could take more money away from you. The game also has a life sim added in the mix but it's not really that great and a bit mediocre,  but I do hope in the future they could improve on it.  Other than that this game is truly AMAZING and a lot more fun than the standard triple a games that huge companies like to create over and over and over again. My only cons with the game is that I wish the npcs were actually human beings rather than robots and there are interactions with them.

A few cons I have with the game.
- There's really no character customizations
- I honestly would rather have real people walking around and interacting rather than robots.
- The ticket prizes isn't really good or worth it.
- Optional mp or someone could visit you would be good.

Seriously, those rides look like riding the real thing. I'm impressed. 

Here's some minor suggestions for the developer. First, it would be nice to be able to see my character. As it is I can only see myself in the very beginning of the game when creating my character. I'd like to be able to see my character during the game and change clothes or customize my character in real time. Second, I want to be able to sit in the chairs, at least at home. I just spent the day playing games, riding carnival rides, buying groceries, and getting hit by cars on my bike. I want to come home and sit. Not stand there looking at the furniture. Third, I want to be able to use the bed. Make it like in the Elder Scrolls games: sleep to regain health and pass time. That's it for now. Although some map/GPS/compass improvements to make it easier to find my way around would be appreciated. Also more actual arcade arcades. Video game arcades. Lastly, do you think maybe we could get some kind of romantic subplot? Have a significant other to play games and ride rides with?

Survival mode is where you are going to want to play. Unfortunately, the game likes to bug a lot and you will lose 75% health for walking down a hill. Get on the bike to close to an asset? DMG! Do something in the store? DMG!

Something that I have not seen, but takes peoples favorite parts from other games
like Yakuza's arcades or any games arcades - and expands it into something that feels fairly real (Aside from graphics and the island being full of bots)
There are many things I wish were added to the game, but as it stands, I am shocked this is so cheap right now, this is easily a 15$ game if not 20$ USD

There are a ton of games, some variants of the same games, like coin dozers or the ones where you have to click the button when the light is in a certain area. There is a Golf Cart that you can refuel and drive around the Island, which clearly, the dev has left open and expansive to fit more and more arcades.
As it stands, as of writing this, and I will update this review when something note worthy is release
There are 2 main arcades and a fair ground with games and rides
Arcade One: Larry's Arcade is like a Chuck-E Cheese, with a mascot band that plays and many games id expect to see at such an establishment. The games are fun, winning virtual prizes is actually nice.
Arcade Two: UFO Arcade, possibly my favorite, seems to have some sorta Laser Tag game, a Indoor Go-Kart track (not massive, but good enough - would love to see an actual go-kart park with a few tracks on it)
and then the games, which look like the floor has room for some more games, which I hope is the plan.
This is enough to fill hours of time, it is relaxing, and it is great if you dont have an arcade to go to, or just dont want to go to one in person.

Creativity on this is great, not stellar, but great, some of the names of games and mascots and the Streets could be more creative, and sound less like some brand of cleaning product that I would buy at the store..
All in all this game has TONS of potential and is very relaxing, almost as relaxing as animal crossing, super close to that level of lax. But I do hope to see more, Would love to see 2 more arcades added:
1: Japanese/Chinese themed arcade with Such themed games, including pachinko,, maybe some type of Samurai themed Coin Dozer with Samural Cards, Could have a mini Japanese themed garden in it, Japanese drink machine and so on, little gate way inside of it, or as the door frame outside and inside.
2: Animal Themed Arcade - something with like Monkeys or Foxes or something like that, could be a Jungle themed arcade with some plush animals to win there.

As for anything else... Music, more SFX, better lighting (it is good, 8/10 good, but there is some flashing and stuttering around shadows and light reflecting off water)and being able to drive the other cars, dirt bike, or atleast being able to customize the Golf Cart that we get, with different bodies, decals, colors/paint jobs...
OH, and Mini-Golf, batting Cage and Bowling would be a great addition to this game filled Island!

Lastly, this game is more than worth the cost, I recommend it 8.5/10 as is
some of the changes since I first played to now have been great, very few have made a couple games less enjoyable to me, but also feel more like the real machine. And the in-game machines are more generous than real life, and it doesnt cost REAL MONEY to play all the games, so, BONUS CRED to the Dev.

I rarely do reviews and I gotta say this game is it`s finest work of brilliance and amazing and utterly addictive game.
I have more fun and money worth in this game than I have had out of these so called AAA games. 

So pros -
Better than most launched games out there.
Graphics are decent, not too shabby and not too hardcore - which I like.
Sink few hours or a few minutes and get rewarded no matter of how little or how much.
Addictive.
Developer seems very active and to say hes on his own, hes doing amazing.
Price - defo got my money worth.
Hits the right spots.
100% worth the £6.19 it costs.

Cons -
Still in early access but there is more coming.
Here and there is a little FPS drops and rarely the game machines do not work properly (reload fixes this.)
Needs multiplay.
V-sync would be nice but if your using a nvidia  you can set this, but be nice if it was implemented in the game.
Rewards would be nicer, say if you buy summit using your tickets it would unluck new areas//features, but like-wise its early access and the dude//madam is on there own, so not a con or so.

Carn`t think of owt else to be honest.
Final verdict..

1000/10 game.. 
Winner in my books.
Truly amazing and worth every penny!

Thank you for a truly amazing game!

I could suggest at a later stage adding possibly a Hunger/Thirst/Energy system - Hunger being Food, Thirst being Drink and Energy being Sleep, when Hunger/Thirst/Energy is low/empty then start taking from players health, you already have foods and drinks inside the game so changing what values they add to would not be difficult after adding said values.

Also I had just failed on my 5th day due to the UI Timers being out of sync, I had 0:6 (minutes/seconds what ever the game refers the second digit as) just as I was walking into the front door, then the timer instantly hit 0 and the stats at the end said I had been over my curfew by -1:06hrs (please don't tell me it takes a full game hour to walk through the door). 

Also the hit boxes for the objects/letters in LARRY's Arcade Machine are really bad, 8/10 times when you pickup a letter, the claw goes full hulk mode and squeezing the absolute .... out of the letter making it shoot out some random direction, most times landing up against the glass, never to be touched by the crane again, this happen to me last night while playing and again today. Having every single 'S' letter stuck up against the glass because of collider issues with the crane is very frustrating, My only fix for this is to exit the game and reload so the machine/objects get reset.
My only suggestion for the claw machines is to somehow code some type of dampening effect for the claws, so instead of the claws forcing themselves to close all the way back to the 0 value it has a spring/slipping effect that instead of trying to crush the object in the claws the strength of the claws slips/dampens having a firm/weak grasp on the object (depending on its time to payout)

I do hope you could take my above suggestions at least into consideration and I do wish you all the best, you really are doing great work and it really shows how far Indie games can come!",1596223192,1596223192

Survival mode was just implemented a few months ago and though not nearly completed it has a LOT to offer.  There is more in a way of goals such as keeping health and stamina up as well as limited income.  There are more job options, as well as more games and more areas to explore.

+ Laser tag and many of the arcade games are very fun!
+ Exploring the world and riding around on your bike is fun! Lot's of cools stuff to see!
+ Being able to save tickets to buy cool stuff, then decorate your room with your trophies is a good idea!
- Many glitches, like getting stuck inside things and having items I won/purchased disapear, can be disapointing. 
- Survival mode is is kind of boring, with long/tedious chores, not enough player direction, little npc interaction, and being late once is an instant game over =(
- The carnaval rides are pretty boring. Little player motivation to actually ride them. 

*SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT*
+ ONLINE MULTIPLAYER: Being able to explore around town with friends and online players, chatting, and challenging each other to high scores on the arcade games sounds SO FUN!!!
+ Add NPC interaction, dialouge, quests, and achievements to survival mode and rename it to something like ""Story mode"" or ""Adventure mode"". Allow players to fulfill quests with a variety of NPCs for money/prizes/access to locations or items. Have mysteries/events around town that the player can investigate, some of which lead to secret prizes or quests. 
+ Instead of loosing instantly for being late, players can now get in trouble and get ""Grounded"", where they have to complete a chore and/or stay home for a period of time (not in real time). This may prevent players from completing timed quests or miss events, giving players motivation and purpose for being a ""good kid"" (or at least being sneaky and not get caught). 
+ Add game mechanics that encourage/reward players for riding carnival games. Maybe have quests or achievements for them, add a new camera mode to get fun/funny pics while riding, or have a mini-game to play during it, just something to motivate players to ride them. 
+ Add races, tricks, and obsticle courses for bikes and golf carts. Would be very fun for quests and in multiplayer!
+ MAKE CHORES MORE FUN!! Make them into mini-games, reduce the amount of work of mowing lawns by a LOT, increase rewards, adding music or something to listen to while working, and making achievements or high scores are all ways to make chores more FUN!
+ Allow players to get jobs, which will essentially be mini-games like cooking or food prep (like cooking games), cleaning, or making deliveries (like Paper Boy or timed delivery quests). It allows for players to earn reliable cash and make earning money fun!

Most of these, I have played in real life ( or similar enough ) and it's very fun to have a game just focused on this. Here's a small list of pros and cons for now. Keep in mind tho, this game was made by ONE person.

Pros : 

- Nostalgia through the roof. Good variety of coin games, even has Go Kart, Laser Tag and some playground rides.
- Ambience is very well done, almost each game has it's quirky music and sound, helping to feel involved.
- You win tickets, that you trade for prizes, that you go sell to a pawn shop, to make money, to play more games.. Easy enough to understand.
- High scores on machines are based on who played on Steam, so you can just play to try to beat the next high scores. Gets you in that ""just one more game"" mood, which is great !
- Semi-open world with stores, houses, 3 arcades ( or places to play games ).
- Vehicles to get to move around, or in birthday mode : Golf cart, bike and free limo transport.
- A lot of things to trade tickets for.

Cons :

- The way your arm holds the gun (?) right in middle of screen is weird.
- Using items is akward, like trying put journal in a mailbox or placing stuff in your room. Lost 1/2 my health just trying to make one journal fit. Maybe I just need practice...
- Big performance hog. Now, yes, this game was made by one person, but requirements for smooth gameplay is through the roof. I play Ori and Will of the Wisp, Warframe, Dragon's Dogma and others with next to no issues at mid-high. This should be easier to run. I have a low system, sure, but I play Ark at a steady 30 fps and this one at 20-25 on potato setting ? Not normal...Dev DID say he's working on that issue though.

Final Score would be a 9/10.

Despite that- I really enjoy this game and just because the con list is long, I still REALLY recomend this game. It's early access and I enjoy what it has so far.

[h1] Pros [/h1]
[list]
    [*] The games tend to be really fun and a lot of variety with the games. I really love the coin dropping games and can't wait to see the other games added.
    [*] Lots of nice little touches with the games and arcade styles. They aren't just blank boxes but have lights and themes to them. Lots of love put into them.
    [*] Concept is super enjoyable. Feels like you're in an arcade really playing some of these games.
    [*] Fun to harass the local robots and fling them around.
    [*] There is a dog you can play with and throw a ball for it- within the yard it resides.
    [*] You can shoot off fireworks.
    [*] You can dumpster dive to collect food, items to resell.
    [*] Immersive with wait times. Bus isn't automatic, food from the carnival takes time to get.
    [*] Actively updating and the developer listens to the community.
    [*] Rubberband shooter to harass local robots. I enjoy shooting the local bullies outside the pawn shop.[/list]

[h1] Cons [/h1]
[list]
    [*] Player models are absolutely terrifying and freak me out so much.
    [*] Survival mode ends as you pass out, or you get grounded. I don't like the fact it ends like this personally. I'd rather have an endless Survival option that instead of the game ending you just get a punishment. Like if you don't meet curfew. your curfew for the next day is shorter.
    [*] Can't go to sleep at anytime for Survival. I understand it's to prevent people from sliding through the achievements, but when I go home at 8:00 and have to wait an hour it's annoying. I'd at least like something more to do at home to get through the time.
    [*] Very easy to glitch through the floor with the bike. Had this happen once then died to it because of fall damage.
    [*] Game doesn't tell you that doing laser tag costs 50 energy. Having less energy can kill you once it's done. Which is frustrasting as it took me three times to find out it was losing energy that was killing me. I thought it was fall damage.
    [*] Island feels empty at times. I know it's Early Access- but I understand this as it's an indie game. I'd like bit more of a small town vibe. Even if it's just some stores for looks. Everything is so far apart even the homes. Your own home feels like you're a king looking down (Especially since you have your own bus stop) and it's not really a vibe I enjoy. I feel like the developer needs to look at actual small towns and how stores and things tend to group together.
    [*] Some of the games are ones you end up playing once and not touching again. Especially in Survival- it ends up feeling grindy and tires me out quickly.
    [*] Putting newspapers in the mailbox is horrible and annoying.
    [*] Mowing the lawn takes way too long and grass grows back next day so you can't do it in parts.
    [*] Cars run you over without a second though. I understand it's to make you be aware of your surroundings- but I feel like they should be able to see you at points and not just barrel into you like some cruel mistress of possible death. The game warns you that they can injure you and take money away- but that never happens to me?
    [*] You have to buy all your food. I get it- you're a human and everyone else is robots. However, I feel like the nannybot (Or your mom?) should buy some new groceries and pet food for you every other day at the least. Same with the babysitter- I want them to restock their food.
    [*] The coin dropper in Larry's Arcade- Dunko- gets glitchy if you win too many ducks without picking them up. It thought I was cheating and kept giving me warnings. On my last warning my game crashed which was super annoying.[/list]",1594178575,1594178701

Like with computer casino games, it gives me a chance to have some fun without losing any real money.  I was not disappointed. The Coin Game is a lot of fun! The fact that it is being done by one guy is very impressive. It has a bunch of different games that are based on real arcade ticket games. There are a few different coin pushers, each with a unique spin. It has a couple different skee ball games, ball droppers and cash blower games. It even has whack-a-mole. One of the arcades has laser tag and an indy cart track.

You can either play in free mode, designed as if it's your birthday and you've received unlimited money to spend, or you can play in a survival mode where you have to not only stay in the positive with your money, but also keep yourself fed with junkfood and soda and be home on time. In either mode, you can redeem your tickets for various items and then either decorate your house with them or sell them at a pawn shop for more funds to play with.

The game has various locales such as two different arcades, a convenience store that sells lottery tickets, and a fair where you can not only ride some different rides, but also play carnival type games like throwing darts at balloons or throwing ping ping balls at the floating dishes. There are various modes of transportation around the island that the game is based in such as a bus, a bike, golf cart and limo. Again, I can't say enough about the amount of stuff to do in this game. The developer, Kevin, is always updating the game and asking for suggestions for new things.

The graphics aren't great, but with as much fun as the gameplay itself is, I don't really mind. The machines themselves look very nice. It's just the environment itself that could use some work. That's really part of the charm though. Your NPCs within the world are all robots. I guess they could be humans, but to me that is again, part of the charm.  For $8.99, this seems like a no-brainer for anyone that enjoys these types of games in real life, or anyone who has wanted to play them but just couldn't bring themselves to spend the money. Shoot, for 30,000 tickets you too can buy yourself a red or blue lightsaber. Give it a try. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1594060925,1594060925

I never thought I would be going to the convenience store to buy food for my pet goose Gary. To be honest I think this game is perfect in almost every way. With each new update it gets better and better. 

I just have one recommendation for the developer. They should add a new mode in where you own one of the arcades. You can name the arcade anything you want and use your hard earned cash to buy new machines, upgrade them, or even hire workers like mechanics to fix the machines when they breakdown. Depending on how much money you make you can start buying other arcades or even things like Jerry's Gas and Go. I personally would love it if you made two versions of this mode, one where you don't really have to worry about going bankrupt, sleeping, or eating, and one where it's somewhat like the survival mode you have now. Where you don't need to worry about a curfew but you should take into account that you need to sleep, eat, and not go bankrupt otherwise it's game over. I'm just spitballing ideas here but I think a lot of people (me included) would love to see this incorporated into the game somehow.

This game has something for everyone to enjoy. I hope all of you give this game a chance because it is
exactly how it is intended to be. A huge time waster. It really draws you in as if you are at an actual arcade or
carnival. The multiple places you can go and play your games too are unique in their own way.

76561198254487540,598980,True,0,0,0,784,594,27,1,"  This game is really fun! The graphics may not be the best you can find on steam, but they have charm to them. The game isn't trying to be hyper realistic, it's very stylized. It's also very atmospheric. There was a larger overworld than I expected, and driving or walking in it makes you feel like you're in a real small town seeking local arcade fun. Within the arcades, there are tons of fun games to play, and depending on my mood, I found myself spending lots of time at only certain games in order to rack up tickets. It's fun, addictive gameplay, and the use of worldwide leaderboards also help to make you feel more immersed.
  As it says on the load up screen it's just a beta version, but it runs really smoothly if you have a quality computer, and the developer constantly updates. As of now there's only birthday mode (aka unlimited money mode) but I'm sure survival mode will be released in a timely manner. Even if it isn't, there's a lot of fun to be had in birthday mode, and you can always just not use the money machine if you crave a challenge.
  Anyway, this game has given me hours of fun so far, and I'm excited to play it even more. To wrap this review up, I'll just say that it really helps when you're in the mood to go to an arcade but either can't afford to or don't have the time to. I definitely recommend adding it to your steam library. It's truly a game for everyone.",1591764290,1591764290

Pros:
-Uncle Phil supports your gambling addiction so you wont go bankrupt
-A nice variety of games to play
-Ride go-karts, play laser tag, or go on carnival rides
-Buy fireworks and set them off indoors (preferably at the go-kart robots they deserve it)
-Pawn off your hard-earned prizes for extra cash or hoard it like the loot goblin you are
-You get your own house complete with some fish and a pet goose
-Goose is potty trained (I witnessed it using the toilet it was pretty funny) and watches TV in its free time
-Deliver newspapers for even more pocket change
-Ride your very own limo (thanks Uncle Phil) if you don't want to use the bus like a dirty peasant
-Shoot robot children with rubber bands
-Ride in your golf cart and get hit by cars
-Purchase some lottery tickets to lose all your money faster
-Dumpster dive for cheesy puffs and soda
-Abuse the robots with no repercussions for your actions
-Games aren't quite as rigged as in real life (idk about some of those carnival games though)
-Survival mode coming eventually if you think you can survive without Uncle Phil
-Leaderboards for each game so you can flex the insane amount of time you've spent on that one specific game
-Popcorn Pete
-Did I mention the goose yet?

Cons:
-Robot peasants ride in your limo with you
-Doesn't seem to be a way to lower the arcade machine sound effect volume (or i'm just dumb which is a high possibility)
-No way to skip 'playing' the money machine which can get very annoying
-Claw machines physics are a bit weird and the machines don't quite work like they do in real life (still fun tho)
-Only 3 claw machines, and only one of those giving plush toys (please give me more these are my addiction and I need my fix)
-Some more arcade machines would be nice since they can get repetitive
-No multiplayer so you are the lone human against the robot overlords

Overall it's worth buying just for the goose",1591404956,1591404956

Each game available at either of the 2 different arcades and the carnival have very easy controls and gives you much of the same satisfaction of winning as if you were at your own ticket arcade. Most, if not all of the games available are based off of real life versions of the game but with creative liberties thrown in to help make the game feel like its own world.

There so much more to the game than just the arcade machines but if you wanted a full review on what the game has to offer i would more at the teaser videos produced by the developer.

Navigating the setting-- an island--is made very facile by a robust bus system in survivor mode and a dedicated (very patient) limousine to travel between locations in birthday mode. Currently, this excellent game features two arcades (with more to come), a carnival replete with ferris wheel and those water gun games I was always so good at. The most pleasantly unusual feature of this simulated island is its population of egg-shaped robots. They sport haircuts and other clothing, they whiz around the zones, they ride the bus, they sell you prizes.

Some of the other features of the island are underutilized at the moment, like the mountainous area and the factories. Currently, your 'home' location is interesting but largely featureless in terms of interaction. But given the strong engagement of the developer, I have strong confidence that these will be nicely fleshed out to the degree of the arcades and the other locations.

I have changed this to a recommended game, as much progress has been made and it really is a lot of fun. I'm still a bit confused by the open world, but I like exploring, so hopefully they do a lot with that. Discovering the amusement park was enough to make me change my mind, because it just feels so authentic (except that I can actually WIN games in this!).
A work in progress, but it's going the right direction.



""So I could only recommend this if I knew what direction they were trying to take. This seems to primarily be an arcade simulator, as I expected, and that part is decent with great potential. However, if you go outside, it's pretty much an open world of random nonsense, none of which seems to serve any purpose. If there was a way to combine the arcade AND open world elements into something cohesive, that could potentially be an amazing game. But for now, neither of those elements feels complete enough for me to consider recommending the game except to support the project. The cynical side of me, however, is not optimistic about the progress. I certainly hope I'm wrong, as the subject matter is GOLD and the early progress has been fun to mixed. The overall project needs more focus onto its strong elements, notably the arcade and ticket stuff, which already reminds me a lot of those kinds of arcades where you would win tickets that you would usually just throw away. After that element is improved a bit, adding open world stuff could be awesome, but one major thing at a time.""",1588471152,1606836165

and also let it be known that though its in need of finishing touches... theres a WHOLE ISLAND available to explore, I chilled on a beach, hiked a small mountain trail, found a space themed arcade far away from 'my birthday party' I even played some Lotto tickets in a shady gas station.

In my opinion this game deserves more players and dev is really cool guy so go support him.
With that out of the way lets talk about whats in the game, how it plays and some problems/weaknesses (I'm going to touch on some planned features and revisit the review when they are added)

So this game is pretty much huge playground for adults to feel like kids again, you have large selection of games, coin pushers (my most played thing), rides and bunch of other small things I'm finding as I play more. 
For me it gives me the same feeling i had when visiting arcade for first time and this is for me and I thing many other players the strongest part of the game.

Good:
Sound and voice acting is great, details like people (well bot) cheering in the background when you win, sound of the machines and employees talking their funny nonsense its just great. 

Gameplay is solid, all the machines are relatively fair unlike their real life rigged af counterparts (some of them are to easy but again early access so more balancing is probably going to be done)

Details, details and more details if I wanted to mention them all I would write an essay (and ruined your chance to find them on your own). For me they show that lot of care and effort was put in the game. I would highly recommend skipping this section and finding out yourself. 

[spoiler]
Reading the text on funfair coin pusher about being not regulated and probably a scam
No tutorial told me there are other things like lotto tickets, fireworks 
Your characters responses when you loose on your lotto ticket basically reads my mind (""next one is going to win""
Back to the future limo
I didn't even know you could play laser tag or that there were different arcades
[/spoiler]

Bad:
One of the weaker parts of the game are physic which sometimes ruin the immersion but considering it's still in early access the core is pretty solid and just needs some more polish. 

As of writing there isn't ""survival mode"" and thanks to that you get unlimited money and everything is freeplay (you get money machine in every arcade and can use it to get more money) but it should be added soon and looking at the dev blog I can't wait to try it. 

What this game really needs after survival mode is added is some sort of build/place menu so you can display your rewards at your home without dealing with collisions and physics because in all honesty I can't be asked to place them with the current system (imagine skyrim/fallout ""hold item"")
On the same note this game needs working rewards like when I use my tickets to buy a slingshot I want to shoot it.

Who should buy this game
If you enjoy the whole arcade experience you are going to love this game and the only one that comes anywhere close is tower unite (I know it wouldn't fit in this game but please give me casino) 
If want to support indie dev and his passion project and are willing to overlook some problems and lack of features. BUY IT
If you are worried about lack of content and features wait for a few months/week and check the news section on steam from time to time. But as it stands and for the price I still think is wort it.

If you don't enjoy funfair games then what the hell are you doing and why are you reading my rambly review?

I'm that guy who saves tickets to buy that 100,000 ticket prize.   With that said I was turned onto this game by Arcade Matt as I didn't even know it existed...thanks Matt!

Bottom line is that this game is incredibly good at simulating most of the popular ticket games out there.  The physics is really good and the content and variety of play is outstanding.  You can play most the standard ticket games but also go to the pier for carnival games.  They even have a bowler roller game which I haven't seen simulated anywhere on the web or in any game.  So if you're into ticket/carnival/claw games you will love this game.   

This is early access and well worth the money.  I've only had the game for a few days and have racked up almost 24 hours already.

The casual one making you the highlight of attention with a 'birthday party', having a free limo take you anywhere you want, allowing you to enjoy all the arcades with no penalties. The competitive one going as far as having to take public travel and/or even walk from place-to-place just to save money and try your luck at profiting from these arcade machines.

A few suggestions would be FPS improvements/polishing if possible, and absolutely a VR mode which would make the fairground rides even more exhilarating!

I was born in 1987, and the 90s represented the time in my life where my friends and I all went to arcades, go-kart tracks, and laser tag establishments for birthday parties. These places are nearly all gone now, but their memory remains. 

Devotid, the sole developer of The Coin Game, captures the essence of these kinds of places (and more, with a carnival and more upcoming locations) in a way that is exactly how we all remember them. The games are generic, of course, but are magnificent facsimiles of actual ticket games. There are no video game cabinets for many reasons, but you can get that experience by picking up New Retro Arcade: Neon. No, this is about getting tickets, redeeming them for prizes... and hanging out with your prize-winning show goose, Gary.

How close does devotid get to the real deal? The physics and lighting are spot on, the back room of Larry's looks like the party rooms of these places, and the carnival even has the exact cups for lemonade that you would expect to find there. However, the one thing that I keep going back to is the carpet in the UFO Arcade. It is black carpet with neon colored planets and the like. It is THE carpet of 90s arcades. It's perfect.

The game is not without bugs, but they are so few as to be basically nonexistent, and devotid fixes them as they arise with new content. As to said content, he updates The Coin Game more frequently and with more content than I see with other EA titles, and he does it all on his own.

Do yourself a favor and pick this up. I don't have the hours logged here that I do elsewhere, but I play The Coin Game very differently from other games. Whereas I min/max and exploit my way to victory elsewhere and measure value in hours played elsewhere, I come back to The Coin Game for short bursts periodically, savoring it for what it is and measuring its value by the depth of the feeling that it evokes.

So for those of you who weren't lucky enough, or can't remember arcades, they were these child casinos that's parents would send they're children off into to spend money, drink sodas, lick doorknobs, you know kid stuff. most arcades were there to take your money so you would beg your parents for 20 more dollars because DAMN IT I NEED THAT RASTA BANANA, and the way they did this was by having these ""Coin Games"" were you drop in a bunch of coins onto a platform that pushes them into a stack of coins, and you would win tickets to win said rasta banana. Well ""The Coin Game"" the game, captures this feeling of late 90's early 2000's doorknob licking fun with a great deal of accuracy, yes I could tell you about the plot, or lack there of, or I could describe some of the game features, but I feel that I could give a better review by telling you about the fun I had with my play time. The first thing I did was of course check out all the games, after I had won 420 tickets in a single game and had a good chuckle about it, I decided that I would check out the live band that was playing, and wouldn't you know it Mr. Rasta Banana is quite a good guitar player, after getting uncomfortably close to Mr. Banana, I decided it was time to check out the island, which my explorations took me to a fireworks stand ran by a robot who was a chain smoker, and in stupid childhood fashion I bought a fuckton of smoke  bombs. ""what to do with all these smoke bombs"" I pondered to myself as my golf cart was hit by a semi truck, I decided to pay Mr. Banana another visit because I felt that his show while entertaining was lacking a certain ""explosive charm"". Satisfied with filling the arcade with green smoke, I discovered that I had a rubberband gun, so I did what any asshole kid would do, I went to the Pier and shot rubberbands at the carnies, they deserved it because their games are rigged, I had $20 left and the sun was setting on my little adventure, it was at this point I decided to buy as many corn dogs as possible and ride the rollercoaster until I puked. You see my fellow gamers, ""The Coin Game"" the game the book the movie, is about that childhood wonder of making your own fun, and being left to your own devices, sure the games, and prizes are fun, but it's the memories you make and the robots you knock over with an inflatable alien

Here's what I think of the game in a pro/con type of format.

The Good:
- Stable and high FPS on a fairly basic PC (1070 + i5-8400)
- Lively
- Realistic Simulation
- Different Locations


The Bad:
- Random lag spikes

The Ugly:
- Looks like a horror game
- Some games are basically unplayable

This review is for the current state of the game. I plan on updating this review as new features are added.

That being said, I have nothing but great things to say about this game in its current state.
""So, what is this game exactly?"", you ask. This game is an open world arcade and fair simulator, with some extra bits attached! People have compared this to a Chuck E. Cheese/Dave & Busters simulator, and this isn't far from the truth. You play classic coin-eating games such as skee-ball, claw machine, coin pushers, and ball dunking games for tickets. You can then use these tickets to purchase prizes such as a plush rasta banana, or a Back to the Future hoverboard! The prizes you win can then be used to decorate your house. Other ""bigger"" games exist too. Examples being laser tag and go-karts. However, these games are a little rough around the edges design wise, and could use some polish.

Some other fun pastimes exist too! Like buying scratchoffs at the gas station, buying and lighting fireworks, driving around town in your golf kart, selling random junk at a pawn shop for arcade money, ect...

It's a lot of fun being able to play these coin-eating machines, and not having to worry about losing real money. The open world aspect is nice, and the idea of having your own home to decorate is great. I very much look forward to future updates of this game. However, I worry about update slowdown because this game is only made by a single person. I fear them getting burnt out, since this game in its conceptual final form seems like a massive undertaking (for one man). 

Anywho, I highly recommend this game. It reminds me of my childhood on New Jersey boardwalks.",1584062662,1584062662

Currently in the works is a survival mode which you need to eat, go home and sleep, earn money by pawn shop your prizes to keep going each day.

I tried playing the game without going for uncles wallet. I tried only using the money you start with and try and my own survival mode. Well the prizes don't sell for that much and you eventually go negative. Or I have not found a game that pays off well.

There is a small arcade like a pizza shop
Then the big arcade like a fun zone with laser tag
Then they have the carnival with rides and carnival games.

----------------------------------------------
My list of Cons:
The game lacks proper lighting, it needs some work. There are unlit areas of the arcade, maybe this is to keep load times down, but this game is dark and hard to see some things.
Lack of options for video settings.
Movement feels sluggish even with 70 fps, my movements and actions seem sluggish.
-----------------------------------------------

The best part of the game is the games it self. Once you slide that card in and start playing, there is no lag, great sound fx and visual fx on the games. The respond instantly without hiccup. But when I am out of a game and walking around the feel and movements feels laggy.

Other then that, really great game with tons of arcade games that actually work and have physics and everything.

There are leaderboards, but I hope one day the game goes multiplayer. I can see this being a blast on twitch.",1582439468,1582513837

It’s almost a scary, dystopian kind of world with being the only human. Robots running around having to recharge themselves and you can mercilessly beat them or treat them like s**t. Yet they just keep doing what they were programmed to do. Some of their dialogue is kinda funny too!

Beware the golf cart needs gas btw! Don’t roll off in the middle of nowhere like I did or get ready to run back.

Speaking of dystopian hell, you can’t even kill yourself in the game. Vehicles just go right through you. I haven’t tried drowning myself after winning 10K tickets on a club slider and being awarded a pencil eraser just yet. But it’s on my agenda.

Overall pretty neat game. I mean the name tells you what it is...it’s The Coin Game. I did warp from the gas station one time over to the UFO center and the error said it was porting me to my last known location even though I’d been to the carnival since them? Could use to fast travel but I get it. Would ruin the immersion and that’s a big part of The Coin Game; immersion.

Spending money in the game is gained by hopping into the money machine and simply grabbing some flying notes in a mini-game, no scummy loot boxes or micro-transactions here, that'd likely be breaking gambling laws in a lot of places anyway.

The Coin Game is a casual simulation game currently in early access that offers hours of content in the form of small arcade machine mini-games. The development team in one guy (yes, [b]A[/b] developer) who has been a charm for this niche community by providing features and games with every update.
I, as well as several hundreds more, adore this game despite the stigma for early access. For ~$10 USD, the fun of being at a birthday supplied by your uncle surrounded by emotionless bots and addictive coin operated games with a functioning prize counter along with a second arcade and pier carnival added with more to come, the entrance fee is a scoff's price for one to fuel their craving of these delightful and addictive ticket-dispensing games. I will address however, the price may grow regarding the scope and scale of the game, so understand it may since have risen. Though there is not a direct multiplayer (at least not as of this review in any case), there is an active leaderboard with the scores and ticket accumulations of every other player to keep your competitive side in check. Also if the game is too casual for you liking, a survival mode is currently under development and is set to release in the near future, the games are not rigged (excluding the carnival games, but that's fair in its own right) and the physics are fine-tuned so each of the mini-games feel fair - and if in birthday mode are not a severe loss. Though there are means of gaining additional income like recycling, pawning, and newspaper delivering that will provide such needs. Just remember that this game is being made and maintained by a single person so be patient regarding any update or announcement and, if I'm being honest, just be glad that the developer is active in the community and fixes and updates the game.

In short, I'd get The Coin Game. It's a nice detour for some downtime to play some renditions of well-known ticket-focused arcade machines that supplies hours of delightful, childish tranquility.",1581201190,1581201190

1. Some of the bots that walk down the street will go through the bus and maybe sometimes glitch out inside the bus. When riding the bus to another location.

2. (I don't know if this is supposed to happen) I went to fill the golf kart with gas while doing so I respawned at the arcade without the golf kart and wasn't able to find the golf kart again. I even went the gas station where I left it last and it was gone.

3. Filling the gas into the golf kart doesn't work too smoothly. Sometimes you have to keep clicking at the gas cap and hope the gas container will do the action.

4. There's still a lot of space that can be filled on the map for other arcade areas. I understand the game is still in the EA phase. I hope more areas will be released when out of EA like an arcade lodge for the mountains and an aquarium arcade. Also some more amusement parks. That would be really cool.

5. Some more prizes for the arcades for the higher tier prizes. The biggest thing I noticed when I lost the golf kart. There was no other way to get around the town aside from the bus. It would be nice to have an alternative option even if it takes longer as a prize to use instead of spending for the bus pass like a rechargeable space scooter or a clown bike. 

Overall, I like the game. It has lots of potential. They're gaps that can be filled to make the game more visually fun and entertaining. Will this game be compatible with VR in the future?",1580852579,1580853010

This game gives a really authentic arcade experience. The first one you start out at has a chuckie cheese feel.

The boardwalk also feels like a typical small town fair but with sideshow games you can actually win.

Overall a very fun world to get around in and play these quarter eating games. My wife is a claw machine addict and after watching me play for 5 minutes, decided to buy it for herself as well.

The game does an incredible job emulating the old arcade experience many of us had as kids... the aesthetics are spot on. The games are simple, but fun and addictive, and it hasn't even been completed yet. The leaderboards serve as a nice incentive to keep playing your favorite machines over and over in order to climb the global ranks.  The physics in the game generally perform very well, with a few wonky moments, mostly visible with the claw machines, where items tend to clip or rubberband a bit around the claws. The game at this time only has the birthday mode, but it is slowly but surely progressing into the full game the dev clearly wants it to be; each update so far has brought a massive improvement.

The birthday mode serves as the mode to play when you don't want to have any worries at all; no time or money management to speak of; you just go to the money-grabber if you run out of cash. Just you, the arcades, and the wide open outside world with lots of things to explore. It's very relaxing! There's a fireworks stand you can buy from, an amusement park with fun little carnival games to play, and two separate arcades with a wide variety of old-fashioned games like Ski-Ball, Claw Machines, Coin Pushers, and other classics you'd see in any real arcade. You even win tickets to get silly little prizes that can range from a glowstick to a giant plushie rasta banana. Yes, you did read that sentence correctly.

There's different themed arcades, and each one has unique features, such as go-karts, carnival rides, or a performing band of electronic prize mascots.

Anyways, pick it up if you like arcade games. And thanks Uncle Phil!",1580437874,1580437874

The current games you can play are pretty decent but a lot feel too similar. There are like 4 coin pusher games, I think 3 claw machines, and 2 ski ball games.

Honestly that isn't a problem for me, but what I'm hoping for is future workshop support so you can make like your own mini-arcade with custom arcade games made by other users, and maybe custom maps.

Just needs better optimization, it runs terrible even on potato on my potato laptop that run games that look more graphically impressive than this game. I am having fun with it but a game with these kinda graphics shouldn't run bad.

If this game can run to at least 30 fps in an update, then i'll recommend it.

I don't pay full price for many games on Steam these days. But the reviews made me take a punt for the £6 asking price.

It's totally 100% pointless. Which is what video games should be all about.

Some suggestions (other than the obvious ""more arcade games!!!""):
-Let me rotate held items in place like GMod! The amount of time I've spent arranging my prizes on the shelves so they look good can be frustrating
-On that, let me furnish my garage? I would love more tables and shelves to properly display all my winnings.

Since it's an early access game I've found several bugs (but nothing major).  The ball machine with all the gears in the UFO arcade sometimes stalls and the ball disappears in the bottom of the machine.  You can't exit the game until a period of time elapses, but then the machine works again.  I also think the Wormhole ball machine also in the UFO arcade is a little too easy; I'm able to reliable hit the jackpot hole 4/4 times each round.

Overall though I really like this game!  Can't wait for new machines to be released :D  Keep up the good work!",1578028427,1578028427

Also if your reading this owner..
Please add a mini -game at the carnaval 
where you try to pick up the right exuse to get money back and keep the ride passes
there is a 50 chance you give him your passes but get money back
28 chance that you get a big amount of money and keep your ride passes
and there is 1 chance they catch you lieing and throw you into jail
also u can risk being caught for escaping prison

Despite what the concept alone might make you think, Most of the arcade games are sound, and actually LESS rigged than in real life. You're not guaranteed to win something every time, but when you play most of the arcade games, you get the feeling there's a fair chance you'll at least walk away with some tickets or even a nice plush prize. In the bigger arcade there's even laser tag and Go Karting, both of which are fairly fun to do. Not to mention there are other various activities to do as well: Launch fireworks off into the sky, buy lottery tickets, buy food and drink to eat (nothing too special there though), and even sell whatever you can carry in your pockets at the pawn shop, prizes from the arcades included. Hell, you can even have a paper route to make some extra cash.

You can buy a bus pass and take the bus around the island, or drive the golf cart around (Just make sure you buy fuel at the gas station, and watch the tank.) 

From what i can tell, you can also decorate your home and room to a degree. I've placed things all over the place, saved and quit the game, came back ,and it was all were I left them.

However, i have one rather glaring issue: the claw games. When you grab something, the phsyics start kicking in, and the jerkiness of the claw will end up throwing out whatever you may have gotten before it can be put in the prize drop, and for me, this happened A LOT. It made them all rather frustrating, especially the Dude, Where's my Cow game. If the dev can get that fixed up-and I really, REALLY hope to see some pinball machines when they do- This game will be a absolute total blast for anyone who really loves themselves some old fashioned Arcade games.",1577973947,1577974237

You play games, win tickets, feed them through the ticket muncher, then exchange them for fun prizes that you can decorate your home with. The game's world is a little creepy at times (I always feel like some Silent Hill-esque monster is going to jump out at me; it won't, but the feeling's always there) but it's still detailed and fun to explore. The navigation system is a bit unreliable on purpose, forcing you to use the environment to find out where you want to go. Or you could just fast travel around.

But I actually do enjoy this game. Very good leisurely game. I like some of the coin and skill games. But just like RL I hate the crane games, they seem almost as pain-in-the-arse as RL ones. ;-) But the developers went out of their way with this one. They made this sort of ""open world"" with a little city, a bus line and other places to go and do things, and you even have a house to stash some of your stuff. One of my favorite prizes I've won so far was the little Star Trek ship, so I thought that was cool. And I love a lot of the pop culture references to Bally's Entertainment, Mountain Dew, Jolt Cola, and others I found. Overall it's a cool, fun little game.

The laser tag is also fun. I just wish the battles went a tad bit longer. Maybe a good idea is a $5 quickie battle and a $10 longer battle, more chances to win more tickets and get in more kills?

Cons: The go-kart needs a little work. You have to use both your controller mini-joysticks to both steer and keep your camera facing where your going- they don't sync, which makes it hard. And if you get off the track, you have to press E to leave the vehicle and lose the race and your $5 in-game fee. (Not a big deal on ""birthday mode"" but I'm sure that might hurt on harder modes. I ended up vertical crashing into a wall, and I couldn't do anything to ""right"" my position and had to quit the race. It's too easy to have this happen. The other ""bot"" karts can also run you off the track, but you can't do it to them at all.",1577877389,1578367690

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[h1] -- I did run into a few issues, however: -- [/h1]

- I'm getting extreme motion-sickness from the way the game controls, the camera moves, and the odd way the player bumps around. I can't play anymore due to the fact I nearly vomited my dinner out. I'm really sad about this. :(

- Sometimes when I'm walking I'll be looking at one of the blue coin pushers, and it'll pop up the 'read card' prompt. I will then get stuck, unable to move (spinning in place isn't a good way to get around the arcade...). I managed to break out of it by using said coin pusher game and that reset the player/camera to an area that I could move in.

- I've also managed to jump my way onto the stage where the band is and get stuck behind the curtain. I managed to get out by clicking the area around the front door and warping outside, but the band wasn't coming back from break. They also disappeared which  is understandable, even animatronics need a snack break.

- A very, very minor glitch I've found lets the player glide-crouch (no animation while moving) and run at the same time. HOW TO: Start moving forward (walk or run), then while doing so, crouch and run at the same time while still moving. You may need to strafe side to side, but this is my favorite way to get around town.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[h1] Suggested Improvements [/h1]

- A Field Of View slider, because I'd love to play this without the bonus of an upchuck.

- Gamma or more lighting options? The flashlight helps some, but it also washes out or blocks details and signs. I am colorblind so more contrast and lighting there is in a dark game such as this, the better.

- More character customization options, please! The proportions of the player characters are a bit odd (Barbie and Ken), but it's mostly the hair style + color, and clothes that I'd like to change. I know it really doesn't matter as we don't see the character outside of the create a game screen, but it'd still be nice IMHO.

- Item and Better Game Descriptions! I found lottery tickets in the dumpster and I have no idea what to do with them. Considering I played for less than an hour, I probably missed something. I do think it would help stop confusion. 
                       >>>Or even an in-game wiki/guide that you could pull up and look through for information so that in timed games you're not wasting valuable money (cough cough Money Booth) trying to figure out what's going on.

On PS3, they had the Midway (1, 2 and 3. It was big) on PSHome.
I never get to go to real carnivals anymore and I love the old school skill games.

The best you can do to emulate the experience has been to download a bunch of different apps on your phone or tablet. Each one covering one particular game.
But then you have to swap apps between games and none of the points carry over.

And then, there's no rides.
No ambiance. 
No real carnival experience.

Enter The Coin Game.
Currently there are three locations on the map that I've discovered.
Two that focus on games and one that focuses on rides.
And they all work.
The ambiance is spot on. Rides have mechanical sounds. Even the electrical buzzing.
The game vendors hawk at you to step up and play.
There's prizes to win. And a global leaderboard!

The sheer number of games and rides in The Coin Game would be enough for a typical developer...
But, this dev goes above and beyond with an open world with a public transport system (with 7 stops) and golf carts, a house to store your winnings, a pawn shop to sell what you don't want anymore, scratch off ticket and a goose (that you can feed).

Not only do the games and rides play incredibly well, but I love the driving mechanics that allows you to look around with the mouse while driving with the keyboard.

From what I've read, the dev is still adding to the game and I can't wait to see where it goes.
Great for fans of New Retro Arcade: Neon (which is a good game to pair this with).
Throw in a pinball game (Zaccaria or Pinball FX3) and you have all-round gaming setup for never-ending arcade fun.",1577154713,1577246352

The arcade games are accurate, albeit far easier than their actual counterparts. This adds to the fun though, as you don't need to play around claw RNG etc.

The atmosphere is eerie and the constant night along with the player being the only human makes for a great atmosphere.

I do kind of wish that the little robots would play some of the games along with me. I think it would just add a bit more life to the world. But that's neither here nor there.

Another thing I want is somewhere to store you won prizes that isn't just your inventory. There are shelves in the player's garage that look like a perfect to place to store your winnings. And while I'm sure you can spend ages trying to move them there, I wish it was a simple one button system.

Stunt driving in the golf cart and exploring the map is a massive highlight, and one of the most compelling features of this game.

The initial appeal is in going to an amusement arcade and playing all sorts of games to win tickets and exchange those for prizes. This game provides a good variety of fun little arcade style games for you to play and you will earn plenty of tickets. It really does give you that amusement arcade experience in the comfort of your own home.

Beyond the fun arcade games, this game is pretty open for you to explore; you can leave the arcade and go out into the parking lot. You can leave the parking lot and go down the street. You can go all around town and find all kinds of things. It gives you this sense of the unknown as you seem to abandon what appeared to be the main goal of the game; to win tickets and get prizes.

This game is a bit of an unusual sort, but for someone like me that's a really good thing. The graphics obviously aren't going to blow you away, but the charm of the game more than makes up for that. The presentation of the arcade mini-games is great and the alluring mystique of exploring the rest of the world outside of the arcade is hard to resist.

The game itself has a very basic idea for a video game, and puts most of it's work into attention to detail. The game is more casual than most others in my library, and despite it's atmosphere at some times, it does not appear to be the ""not what it seems"" games.

You play as a kid, I assume, who is having a birthday at an arcade. The game's main ticket (no pun intended) is to be similar/reminiscent to many arcades that exist(ed) around the U.S.A. during the 90s/00s. Because of this, it's key keeper is nostalgia, which only lasts so long, but which can influence the game's reviews.

You open the game and you get to choose your character. You can either be a man I can only describe as the true god of arcades, or a girl who looks like a rejected Emergence character. This only comes up again if you look at yourself through the automated pawn shop's security camera.

The game begins. It's your birthday. Your rich uncle Phil has, supposedly, rented out an arcade. But when you enter, something's different. Your friends and family are not here to celebrate with you. Instead, you are surrounded by robots that sound like screaming children. Do I have no friends? Did uncle Phil rent these bots too? Where are the people?

A show quickly begins. An animatronic band plays generic music. The band consists of a teddy bear guitarist whose paws phase through the guitar, a rastafarian banana on a saxophone, F L E S H  S H A R K, and a hang loose hand playing the bongos. It is at this point I realize I'm playing a horror game. 

In the next room are many familiar arcade games, except from the mirror dimension. Classics like that one scam game where you have to fit a key into a hole that is clearly too small to fit the key, claw machines, skeeball, coin dozers, and legally distinct versions of Monster Drop, Quik Drop, Zombie Snatcher, and Stacker await to take my rich uncle Phil's hard-earned money. This is the bulk of the game. These games play like easier versions of their real-life counterparts, in part due to the fact that the physics are more forgiving than in reality and the controls are much more functional than in reality. These games spit out tickets, you feed the tickets into a satisfying (though environmentally unfriendly) ticket shredder, and the ticket value is loaded onto your universal access card, which is what you use to interact with everything from arcade games to automated pawn shops to the golf cart you use to drive around the island.

The island is populated entirely by these bots. Some of them operate the businesses of the island, like the gas station. You can buy gas for your golf cart and scratch-off tickets at the gas station. I buy a ticket. I win nothing. Who are these bots working for? Are they sentient? Do they want to escape? Why am I the only human here? I will never receive answers to these questions. I resign myself to my fate as I purchase another scratch-off ticket. No winner. I hastily stuff the crumpled tickets into my backpack. If I am to survive here I must ration out my money.

The only food available is junk food. Soda, chips, candy, carnival desserts. It's becoming clear to me now. Uncle Phil has damned me to this child's existence. Living only so I can play more arcade games. What have I done to deserve this fate? Who is my character? Who is uncle Phil that he can afford this island, separated from society, to be my prison? I ponder the nature of my existence as I stuff my losing scratch-off tickets and meager arcade prizes into the ""pawn shop,"" a device which exists solely to shred the fruits of my labor and give me cash in exchange. I chuckle at the metaphor for the existence of the working class under capitalism.

Exhausted from the first day of my new life, and realizing I have lost my golf-cart somewhere along the line, I summon my limousine and have Jeeves bring me to my home. I feed my prized award-winning goose, then my fish, and turn the game off.

10/10 perfect game.",1574936031,1574936031

Some of games there are really challenging to get any tickets from (mainly the Prize Locker) while others are so easy to farm tickets from that it becomes comical (the ball claw madness game). Most of the other games fall between these two extremes, being able to get tickets from them while not being as ""farmable"" as the claw games are.

The travelling carnival was quite nice, some of the games like the darts took a little time to get used to. The race game was pure bullshit since it felt like it was hard to judge when you were doing right, didn't help that all the AI opponents played it perfectly. While it was cute that the dev added rides to the carnival area, didn't really care about it (would have preferred more games to rides).

My only real complaints are that the golf cart drinks fuel like if it was a 18 wheeler and that the scratch cards didn't work the way scratch offs usually do (can't even scratch all the ticket before the game decides if you win or lose, minor gripe cause I am here for the arcade games).

In short I think this game is quite nice and I look forward to the parts being worked on (wrote this review before the UFO arcade was released). If I could wish for anything, it would be for some classic arcade games as well as some pinball games.",1574241080,1574241080

The game is currently in Early Access and has a few bugs here and there but that doesn't take away from the experience of the game. It's an arcade simulator, where you play arcade games to win tickets and trade them in for prizes. This game is a one man project which makes it all that more amazing of an achievement.

The arcade makes up the majority of the core gameplay but there is a lot more to do including visiting the fairground on the port, taking a bus, doing paper rounds to earn money or even trying your luck at a scratch card. It's almost like being in a real life simulator except you have no responsibilities at home and your life is spending your life savings on Dunko or the Mega Drop machines.

The game is receiving updates at the time of this review being written and is worth a shot anyway. The game isn't much and I got it full price and I don't regret it. I get a lot of content for the money and I hope to continue supporting this endeavour. With the real life arcades seemingly going towards a more convenient card friendly approach, this game is a nostalgia hit. I don't think real life arcades are on the decline either but this is the only arcade I can come back to time and time again without having to spend more than a one-time entry fee.",1573818002,1573818002

The Coin Game is great for those like myself who are housebound due to a chronic illness.  I can enjoy arcade games in the comfort of my home.  

There would only be a few minor things I would like to see changed.  

The carnival games on the island have a number of coin slots but you can only use one - would be nice to have the freedom to choose any of them - stand anywhere to play the game.

The coin pushers inside the arcade give you money instead of the prizes.  It would be nice to have the option to keep the prizes or exchange them  at the ticket desk for money.  

Also could the coin pushers at the carnival have different prizes than at the arcade - just to extend the variety.

I would like to see improvement in the female characters facial features - give her eyes some eyelids as she looks shocked to me not having fun at all.

I do not know if this is a bug but there is a few times I got the big jackpot in the mega drop and no cash was given out.  The rest of the games work fine.

Despite those minor little things my whole family love this game - game play controls with keyboard and mouse work great.  The game is visually appealing and sounds like the real thing.

You've made us nerds happy being able to play arcade games and fair games without wasting our actual bank accounts. I know the game maker won't see this but here is my idea to make us a little more happier and sucked into this 80s feeling world: 

1: More rides and arcade games at the fair- 
2: Please add, Pac Man, Space Invaders, Galaga and other classics if possible-
3: More food buying options like maybe a hunger, and health bar to mantain or body needs-
4: An option to buy and drive a car as well as buying houses- 
5: PLEASE add the classic games that took tokens and coins instead of cards like in real life- 
6: I know odd jobs are there, but maybe add other jobs to make us actually work for our arcade spending money like, fast food worker, firemen, police, garbage person, and possibly ride operator and work at the fair? 
7: Please add more human NPCS to interact with like workers or gamers. The robots and band are awesome but it gets lonely. 
Either way this game is really fun and hopefully the fair gets bigger and maybe options added above would make me buy the DLC if one was added.

1. This game has a lot of potential, especially if they keep adding content like the latest games and activities in the UFO Arcade.
2. I enjoy the coin pushers and claw games the most. I am hoping the developer continues to refine and polish, as well as the new added features like Dunko.
3. I have a lot of fun paying different games, but exploring the island seems lacking at the moment. IMO I would like there to be hidden areas where we might find parts to assemble our own arcade game for our garage.
4. Highly recommend this game if you enjoy arcade coin pushers, claw games, etc.

Lastly, at Larry's Arcade, recently the developer changed the claw machines. They are more difficult, but they are not very rewarding now.

Go to the carnival down at the pier, go to the weird crashed UFO, go sell your arcade winnings at the pawn shop or scavenge through the garbage for recyclables to get more cash. Abandon your golf cart and wander off into the dark wilderness and really start to question if this is a horror game in disguise.

Quite possibly the best game of 2019, featuring photo image graphic techniques and state-of-the art physics similar to real life. The game takes place on a bustling island called 'IslandVille' inhabited by interesting robot-like creatures in which you can store in the back of your golf cart and throw under the bumper cars.

[u]The Arcade[/u]
The Arcade features revolutionary arcade games which brought a smile to my face whilst memories of a simpler time came to mind, no thoughts no worries only how many 10p coins I had left to fill the machine with. The survival horror aspect of the game comes to play when the band begins to play in the other half of the arcade: Teddy, Rasta Banana, Keyboard shark, and the hand bring you to the end of your seat as you watch them commit violent war crimes in what appears to be some sort of performance to strike fear into the hearts of their enemies. The many games featured in the main arcade hall are all very entertaining to play except dizzy bird, Fucking remove it from the game you scum cunts its bog shit annoying.

[u]The Pier(Carnival)[/u]
The Pier newly added in a recent update makes the other portions of the island lighten up. The pier features nostalgic carnie games like the water gun game and the ping pong ball throw(in which you cannot win). The pier also contains many rides which you need to buy a ticket for at the front entrance where it gives you limited shots, word of warning these rides are INTENSE and are EXTREMELY immersive to the point where the normal player needs to look away to avoid convulsions.

[u]Prizes[/u]
After collecting 85%+ of the prizes i'm glad to say that it is worth collecting them as they brighten up your garage. The satisfaction of collecting your first prize is glorious and I can only wish to relive the moment as it filled me with ECSTASY. The design and pure craftmanship put into the prizes makes the experience all the more better with the rasta banana resembling a joint and the teddy bear fucking T-posing its safe to say the art design in this game was that of bob ross stoned.

I stumbled upon this game with a few YouTube videos & was intrigued to pick it up.  I have not been disappointed with this game.  The Coin Game started as a ticket redemption arcade simulator, but has recently added (at time of writing) carnival games to the mix.

Just to get the negatives out of the way...  [b]This game is in a rough state.[/b]  Some of the games are a bit buggy & may not properly as well as some features (like Survival Mode) are still missing, but the game is Early Access & still being worked on.  Therefore, I'm expect these to get smoothed out in the future.

On the positive side, the arcade & carnival games within are faithfully recreated inside The Coin Game.  With Birthday Mode, you can enjoy the games without a care in the world (only a temporary inconvenience that can be fixed by hitting the Money Booth) & is currently worth the price of admission ""as is"".  I hope to see more things in the future as it rounds closer to completion.

76561198036835315,598980,True,1,0,0,512,182,929,16,"This is a really nostalgic approach to a ""simulator"". The focus is on arcade coin-op games that are known difficult or sometimes outright rigged in nature, and now fairground games. 

The premise is really nostalgic and kinda designed at reliving childhood memories of going to pierside arcades (the phenomena is more or less the same in the UK as it is in the States), here are some impressions and suggestions that I have for mechanics:

1. The balance/logic of the machines should be split to being Fair or Rigged (as a difficulty mode or with some machines being more rigged than others. Machines sometimes even have dip-switches to eliminate RNG based mechanics and have it be purely skillbased). A distinction between skill based or games with obstacles or RNG that will almost guarantee a loss. For example, Stacker should be easier on a ""fair"" difficulty and be dependent on skill alone, but we know in real life, games like Stacker (or Key Master) use a payout rate when at the final major prize to fail you by ticking over by one block, regardless of how good your timing is https://i.imgur.com/55CeJND.png (oddly enough, in my experience minor prize stacker was quite difficult, i'd expect it to spike in difficulty when entering Major). Mechanics such as input delay should also be implemented to make your life harder in games that use moving parts like claws. The claw game could also randomly release/loosen mid-travel so that it's considerably harder to win. One can also add coinop games into stores and places outside of arcades with better RNG and higher winrates, where the drop rate would be lower as not as many people go to play there.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0A5PABiT5A

2. Addition of the following games:
a clone of BarBerCut (the game where one cuts a wire to drop a prize, a video with an overview of the service manual and how the game is rigged to be more luck based here:)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-5e8Q_SzQY

a clone of The Amazing Road Trip (a game similar to big bass wheelin where one has to reach specific goals and hit enough numbers to progress through different prize tiers.) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scRUAGjAA20

a horse betting/roulette like coin op game which is pure RNG.

3. model in more prizes as equippabble/interactable items, such as the fidget spinner or swiss army knife

4. add some toys into stores to be purchaseable alongside being winnable in arcades.

5. Bumping, shaking machine. One could potentially bump or shake a machine to move a piece or prize to a desired position, with a chance for some machines to trip a protection against such a thing that could have consequences...

Overall a really cool concept and I hope that it continues to be a fully fledged title that is rich with games with a specific meta. The art of coin-op games is nostalgic and can be depicted in a pretty intricate and fleshed out way (with different prizes, winrates, physics, etc. etc.)",1562974959,1574944168

EDIT 1/6/2020:
Devotid has added a lot of amazing things to the game. It's so good. This game is gonna be amazing once the survival mode gets here. There's kart racing and lazer tag, immersive fast travel, bus rides, and tons of new games now. There's a pet goose at your house. They also improved some of the games to make them unique.
____________________________
I love this game so much, I'd pay way more money for it. To most people this game may just be ""a time waster"" but I really enjoy it. The game is in very early access so you should be expecting some flaws and issues when purchasing it. It is a very unfinished game. Things like not being able to save indoors so you will have to exit the building, save, then re-enter. A minor inconvenience to most, I do not mind it much. There is no auto save so you need to manual save frequently. I did not have a single crash in all my time playing, so I wouldn't worry much about lost progress. The survival mode is unplayable as of now. Meaning you can not even access it.

[*] The graphic options are too simplistic. I appreciate that they are there at all but some of us (like me) are very picky and snobby about that sort of thing.

[b] What I like about this game: [/b]

I love the mini games like the claw machines and the coin pushers, as well as the dumb chicken thing. It's all very nostalgic to me. The machines all look and sound amazing.

The scratch tickets are awesome.

The rides are also done very well and they are pretty immersive. The developer did a very good job at making a ride feel authentic to the point you may actually start turning your head while riding it and feel a bit of the acceleration. Something I found impressive being that this isn't a VR game. 

The choice to use robots instead of human models was really cool and they're a lot more interesting to watch and interact with than a cheaply made human NPC would be. They make all sorts of weird noises that aren't annoying and when you win big on a machine they'll swarm you all excited. 

This is the most fun I've had with a game in a very long time and I wish the developer the best. [u] This is much more special than a simple time waster. [/u]


Thank you so much for this game and I hope your development goes smoothly. I know how rough it can be. You're doing great.",1562929646,1581468206

I have tried many games in my past and I always hesitated when it came to early access games but after watching Brutal Moose's Youtube video about The Coin Game I had to try. Not only I did not hesitate to buy it but this was my second game in my whole life that I've bought without trying it first. Every arcade machine in this game has a character taken from the real life arcade machines and it is just fantastic. I am looking forward for many updates to come, thus I can recommend this game who has nostalgic feeling for fairs or arcade places. Of course this game is not only for people with nostalgic feelings I would definitely say to try this game for everyone who wants something new, something more open. I am hoping that in the future developers will also create some arcade machines that are not only based on real life examples but something from their imagination. 

Another reason why I recommend this game is because it's not only arcade machines, it's a full on RPG and what I can see from developers already that they are expanding this role-play idea, which I really love and adore. Give this game a chance and you'll see what I mean:)",1562875214,1562875214

I heard about The Coin Game from BrutalMoose on Youtube like most people, honestly I was putting this game off because of the graphics and generic name.

Now that I have the game, I can completely understand the appeal, especially to an arcade lover like myself. There aren't really any other arcade game-games on Steam at the moment, and TCG makes it up by a whole lot!

I plan to update and edit my review as long as this game stays in Early Access, I am usually wary of funding Early Access projects but seeing how much work Devotid has put into this completely ceases my worries.

As the game is, it's fantastic, especially knowing how hard the developer had to work to get to this point. There's ton of your favorite arcade games, lots of prizes to win, and now there's a carnival for even more content! I'm highly looking forward to the UFO location and Survival Mode.

As it goes, I really don't have any complaints about this game, it's quite great as it is with some work needing to be done to make it complete. I'll be listing things I think should be added below, and much more.

(Note: I'm not sure what is in the works ahead, so some of these might be being worked on already.)

Things I'd Like To See Added:

- Subtitles (English)
- Fullscreen / Windowed Mode
- 'Cyclone' Arcade Machine
- Plushie Claw Machines
- Tickets aren't a static entity and come out and pile up depending on amount. (i.e. 5 tickets looks the same as a pile as 1000 tickets)
- Card Based Coin Pushers (Cards are dispensed into the machine when you fill up a meter or so by playing, collecting a card grants an amount of tickets, collecting all cards as a set grants a big bonus of tickets!)
- Being able to bring up your smartwatch while on the bus or while playing a game
- Character Customization
- Sleepiness/Awake Meter in Survival Mode (can be fueled for a short while before a crash on coffee/soda)
- Knock down the Clowns Carnival Game
- Able to view leaderboards fully on your smartwatch from your position up to the lowest or highest position on record
- Teddy and the Ticket Eaters should have a song where they sing / multiple instrumentals or more songs
- Coins that pop out of the Coin Pusher should be added back to your credit count
- Be able to view every free side of the claw machines at different camera angles

Bugs/Problems I've Noticed:

- The coin pushers' letters sometimes do not light up, despite being run over by a coin, sometimes this happens multiple times
- Mega-Drop sometimes reloads the ball to re-drop even though it's already gone into a hole by then
- Mega-Drop ticket lag when you get the ball in the hole, it takes a while for it to register the number or thing it's supposed to do
- Turning your head on the bus while sitting makes you able to see your character model in a wrong way when you shouldn't
- Jumping up on Stage and running into the Rastafa Banana sometimes lets you warp through the stage and into the back (not sure if this is an intentional 'secret' or not)",1562718947,1562718947

But I was disappointed to find that the physics in these games are not even remotely accurate. Everything is far too easy, and the crane physics in particular are laughably inaccurate having both a very strong grip and constant twitching and glitching. You also can't view the side of the crane machines while playing them, something necessary to be able to gauge depth. The yakuza games had crane minigames that did this and despite not being very accurate either, at least did it better.

I really hate to give this a negative rating because this game was clearly made by a single developer who tried their absolute hardest, and I commend them for doing the best they could, but it really shows that only one entity was behind this when you see how empty the world is. There is essentially nothing to do besides the few arcade game simulations. Nowhere to put your prizes or any way to interact with them besides picking them up with the ragdoll physics and stuffing them into your inventory as a jpeg. You can walk outside in the dark all over town in a surprisingly big overworld, but it's mostly empty ground with a few buildings like a pawn shop and a gas station that you can minimally interact with. Updates are slow to come, again because of the solo developer, who is clearly passionate and doing their best. It also feels very lonely, being basically the only human in the world. It feels weird going to an arcade and a carnival all by yourself to play the prize games alone, but that's probably just a personal issue.

To give only the positives: this is an extremely good piece of work for a solo dev. A few games like that stacker game, the hocky game, and the carnival rolling game, feel very right. There is definitely a lot of fun to be had. You will get a nice burst of nostalgia if you remember playing these games or just want to play an arcade infinitely on easy mode. The outside world feels very comfy at night and can be very immersive just to walk around. The new carnival update is an interesting addition and pretty impressive for the amount of work they put into it.

Sadly, the inadequate physics earn this a negative review. Nothing in this game is realistic. The coin pushers in particular exemplify the bare bones nature of the physics here. I'm still very much looking forward to the UFO arcade update with how obsessed I am with japanese arcade machines, but I personally doubt it will be anything better than the crappy yakuza UFO catcher minigames.

I don't regret supporting this developer, they did a very good job and are clearly passionate about their work, but I would not recommend this for anyone looking for an accurate arcade simulation/game.",1562467256,1562467256

This game sounds, looks, and feels like nostalgia. I can't believe how accurate the sounds are, right down to the heckling from the carnies, it brings me back to the county fair immediately minus all the annoying insects and heat.

The muffled chatter from the beer tent that you can hear from the ferris wheel, the cheering of kids from the stage while you play games on the other side of the wall, the sound the wheels on your cart make when you slowly move to a stop, the rumble from the fair rides, it sounds exactly like childhood in every way. I don't know how the dev managed to create this exact feeling, but they executed it brilliantly. I could smell the fairground clearer than when I was last there.

One singular dev managed to make a game more moving and emotional than entire AAA studios, which is crazy impressive and I salute you. This game is EXACTLY what anyone could ask for in a virtual arcade experience, and the sense of peace and longing is completely unparalleled. I kinda wish Steam had a star rating system so I could give this game a six out of five.

Solo developer with good communication and a positive, responsive community on the forums.

Open world design with lots of things to do.   There is a plan to add a story / survival mode.  When that happens, I will start racking up some serious hours in this game.

For someone like me who loved going to places like this as a kid, this game gives me a huge sense of nostalgia and I just love it. In fact, this was probably the first game I've bought in some time at full price, just because I got a strong desire to play it that badly.

As for completion, most of the achievement have to do with playing the arcade games and earning tickets and buying various prizes. Chances are after you're done giving each of the machines a try (since pretty much every game is fun to play), you'll find one game in particular that you're really good at and can earn a bunch of tickets quickly and stick to that to earn these achievements. There's also a couple of achievements to earn in the overworld related to earning money that are easy to do. It's not really important now, but once the survival mode is put in I'm sure things like recycling and the paper route will be vital to earning money so you can feed your Skee Ball addiction.

It is worth noting the game is still in early access, hence why some of the achievements are unimplemented. They mostly have to do with the survival mode that isn't in the game yet, but will become available sometime soon. The updates for this game add a good bit of content and are really fun to play, and revisiting your favorite cabinet from time to time can be fun and relaxing.

Honestly, I really dig this. It's essentially an arcade filled with several types of games that you'd find in a typical arcade.  I frequent my local arcades and I can tell you many of these games are the most faithful virtual recreations I've played. There's about a dozen games now with prizes to be won with the tickets. There's also quite a bit of area to explore, with plenty of ""construction"" around while the dev revs up for more content.

More stuff to do outside like more buildings to enter
Make ski ball more challenging

It's a simple arcade simulator, but its just so easy to get lost in playing. One minute you're just trying to get the jackpot on Quick Drop, the next hour you're doing scratch-offs to try and get more money to feed your addiction to Dunko.

I love how it isn't just an arcade, and how there's a whole world outside of it. To be fair, there's a lot that's still under construction, but whats there is great. The pawn shop, convenience store, its just nice to explore.

One of my favorite parts of this game is the leaderboards. It really makes it feel like there are people constantly running in and out of the arcade and trying to beat eachother's high scores.

And I never expected there to be THAT much outside of the arcade itself. The animatronic band is fun(so long as they don't bite off any heads), and with the card and the ticket counter it feels likes a bit of a hybrid of of arcades I've been to.

I find the robots cute, especially how they've been designs with different clothing, hair, even beards, and I kinda quickly found a guilty pleasure of dragging them in front of oncoming cars...... The recently added fireworks are fun too, as is the rubber band gun.

My only real criticism that might be addressed later is the lack of a mouse sensitivity setting, I'd like to raise it some.

Well, the other which I imagine might get changed is the choice player models, I mean no offense to the creator if it's their own work but I just kinda find them ugly, and both look perpetually startled, but I imagine that might change later. Some more option or being able to customize would be nice too.

All in all I would recommend this game, it captures the feel of going to an arcade well, there's a surprising amount to explore outside, and I look forward to future updates.

You can drive your golf cart around the island and explore it, gamble your life away with lottery scratch tickets, get fireworks, drive into cars and fly into outer space, and try to get all the tickets you can to get the biggest prizes. I personally find this game to be fun and relaxing, even my friend watching me play had fun. If you are into playing arcade games and looking for a relaxing time overall I would recommend to either get this game or keep this game in mind and and wait for more updates to come. 

This game is epic

This one is basic and fun especially considering the price tag I'd hop on the early access train any day of the week for this, more arcade games will be added as time goes on; solo dev and I already feel like I got my moneys worth as it currently is, can't wait for updates to see what gets added & polished

I was a bit on a random buying spree and on impulse given my fair nostalgia for arcades (A rarity now where I live, closest is in our capital which for me is far) I decided to give this a try. I played for like one hour without even realizing it'd been that long, just listening to a video on my phone while playing some games. Kinda stopped to wonder if I should refund this, but next day, I got back on the game and realized exactly how I can have fun with this, just play this idly while doing other stuff, and relax.

This game is super chill in the only current mode of Birthday, it has a few quirks that need to be ironed out, and personally I would like to see the performance worked on, but then again given my light experience with the gaming industry I personally know that that specifically isn't always top priority. I'm amazed at the fair longevity this can have, and personally can't wait to play this more, see what else the dev has in store, it's def worth the money but do remember that yes, it's Early Access, so you're gonna have a bit of a tough time. But it's fun.

Currently the game's balance as for ways to get money is in my personal opinion still lacking, but again, early access. For example: A paddle ball that costs like 750 tickets goes for more money than a plush candy toy which costs more tickets, and even the amount of money you get from prizes ends up seeming a bit too much, making tickets seem practically worthless right now as some machines can give you tons of them in one go (Like the dropper which after some practice you get timings down to get multiballs and jackpots easily). Still, good game, but hopefully in the future ballancing will be taken care of.",1557663255,1557663584

So this is more then just a arcade game witch makes it more worth the money in my opinion. even though it is still probably worth it just for the arcade you won't get the experience of a real arcade 100$ but it gives you some thing close to it in your own computer and a new experience to it's got a old game feel to it probably because it's in early access.

This game simulates the long forgotten dark ages where you actually needed to get up and leave your house to play games! There are many classic arcade machines there, skill crane games, those coin drop games, the Big Bass Wheel, some games where you drop balls into cups and try to get all 50 for that sick jackpot bonus. Play games, win tickets and redeem them for cool prizes! There are two planned modes but only one is in the current build at the time I am writing this, which is the ""Birthday Mode"" which is just sandbox mode, though there is a survival mode planned, where you need to work for money, get home on time, and survive off a diet of soda and cheese doodles like Mother Nature always intended. You can also leave the arcade and explore around the Island a bit.

Then I played a game called Cuckoo Coins and won several lighters, pocket knives, and fidget spinners.

I drove around busy streets in my golf cart and was struck by a large semi-truck and just kept driving like a G.

I went to a doggy bone factory and found it was inactive, I blame China.

And then last but not least, I went to a pawn shop to recieve currency for my bent empty soda cans and paddle ball.

11/10 would spend 20 minutes trying to get the damn bonus balls to drop again.

Well to cut to the chase, for one guy working on this he is doing an impressive amount of work/progress in making this a full fledged game. 
Besides that, listening to the gamer's and adapting to survive will make this game much better over time.
With that in mind I would like to throw my hat into the ring and suggest my own idea.
Please add some pinball machines and maybe some retro style arcade games, I would gladly spend the life I have 
(outside work hours) playing this game.

I really love the variety of games played although some values are weird - as the faux keymaster is played for $5 while something else is played for $0.50 and most of them at a rate of $1 - there should be either some constant for the game.

While I love the creations right now, I would love to see how the developer handles some other arcade classics, such as ""cyclone"" (that light bulb game) ""deal or no deal"" (stop or go?) ""red hot"" (a bounce ball game) and some other skill games, like basketball, ring toss and clown dunking, but as this is Early Access, I can only assume the developer has these ideas in future updates, in addition to the story mode...

The Arcade right now is really good, and I love the silly prizes, Teddy and the Ticket Eaters is the greatest way to take a break from all the arcade gaming.

I already love this. I know it won't be everyone's cup of tea, but as someone who doesn't live anywhere near an arcade and loves the ticket games this is almost a godsend! 

Claw machines, coin pushers, Monster Drop, Dizzy Chicken, an ICE HOCKEY version of Zombie Snatcher, vending machines, a ticket eater, a prize area and a machine which lets you grab more money? And an island to explore with lorries and buses and a golf cart? And cheesy snacks? And the promise of a 'survival' mode in which you have to earn money to play and eat?

They have so much more than just the arcade games in here as well, like one arcade has go karts and laser tag! I know you can pawn off prizes and such, and it looks like there is a leader board for tickets won as well. Awesome that they have a way to get more money by delivering papers as well as other tasks, great idea to give the game a way to keep playing if you run out of cash. Runs great!

I originally passed on this title after playing the demo, but later bought in after watching a streamer. It boils down to the demo not conveying the whole sandbox aspect.[/i]

[b][i]The Coin Game[/i] is really neat.[/b] The best comparison is to [i]My Summer Car[/i], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/mastatsan/recommended/598980/]as said by The Carlz0r[/url]. What this means is that while we have a main gameplay focus on earning tickets from arcade games (with individual Leaderboards!), but there is also this whole sandbox going on. You have a fairly large island to explore and do odd and zany things. I delivered papers, got addicted to scratch-off tickets, and found a UFO. Things like that.

[b]What I do need to convey is that there isn't all that much content right now.[/b] The arcade games are good fun, but there are only a handful at this point. The island is large, but we only have one job of a paper route so far. There is a lot of potential, and I can easily recommend it in the current state for the small asking price, but you should know what you are getting into. I explored just about everything and got the Achievements I wanted all in under 2 hours. But I did have fun. I really hope this gets constantly expanded, because the sky is the limit with this one. It would be awesome to have a large community with Steam Workshop support.

[b]Pros:[/b]
+I love this new niche genre of open sandbox with strange goals
+This is quite fun
+While there are only a few things to do, they are done right
+Individual Leaderboards for each arcade game go a long way here

[b]Cons:[/b]
-Hopefully this project doesn't get dropped, and a ton of content is added over time
-There are plenty of rough edges (cars have no AI and just plow through you, arcades glitch out; things like this)

Positives ;
*The game has a strong sense of nostalgia for those birthday parties that we all went to as kids. 
*The arcade games are all time classics and they mostly have an easy pickup and play feel. 
*Well priced, the game is currently £5.50 (£6.19 at full price) which I feel is about the right price for this. 

Negatives;
* IMO the player character models just don't work. Currently the models are shown to be adult which doesn't work with the setting. Personally I'd play into that nostalgia factor and make the player character a kid or maybe even one of the kid robot. 
* There's not much to do outside the arcade and the gas station. Tbf this will probably change in future updates (especially with survival mode promised) but as I review this, there's a large map but not much there to do. 

A tentative thumbs up from me as The Coin Game shows promise but in it's current form, the game is missing its raison d'être.

Edit

Since this review, there have been a number of updates to the game including an overhaul of the player characters. The models look much better, now with customisation options. Still feel that the nostalgia factor would work with this game more but hey, they do look much better. 

In terms of content, it has been announced that there will be more games like dodgems/bumper cars. Hopefully there will be a way for the AI to join you as that would be quite enthralling. 

Still stand what I said previously but it's no doubt getting even better.",1551143883,1553118529

Outside the central focus of The Coin Game arcade, the player is free to explore an entire world with secrets, jobs, businesses, a bus system, a golf cart to drive around in, lottery scratch-off tickets, and more.

Currently, as of the time of this review, February 2019, the only mode available is Birthday mode.  You have easy ways to get infinite money, and no real needs, so you are free to play the arcade games and explore the world at your leisure.  Survival mode is not yet playable, but many of the elements that will be a part of that, such as being able to sell stuff for cash, dumpster dive for items and money, and working a newspaper route are already present in the birthday mode to try out.

It'd be easy to pass this by and write it off as typical steam junk at first glance, but I encourage you to try it.. especially if you like oddball open-world games in a similar spirit to My Summer Car.  I've mentioned that comparison twice, because that's probably the strongest vibe I get, comparison-wise.  Anyway, it's neat, and it's cheap.  Check it out.
